Thesis Project: Toponym Resolution

An algorithm that resolves toponyms identified in transcripts of oral histories located at Cline Library's Special Collections and Archives.
This algorithm gets data from Wikipedia to calculate a 'weight' score. Wikipedia is used to determine the 'prominence' of a candidate location for the toponym.
