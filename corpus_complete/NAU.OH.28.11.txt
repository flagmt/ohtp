SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. This is an interview with Peter J.Lindemann, who has been a <Flagstaff> resident since 1917 and is a <Flagstaff> native. His profession is dentistry and he was the mayor of <Flagstaff> from 1956 to 1958. Interview is being conducted on January 12 at 517 W. Apache Rd. which is his home. The interviewer is Susan L. Rogers, representing the Flagstaff City - Coconino Public Library.

SUSAN ROGERS: Dr. Lindemann, when and where were you born?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: I was born in <Flagstaff> and my home- and I was born in my home on 23 S. Agassiz. which is the corner of Agassiz and Cottage Av. And that's where I spent about the first nine years of my childhood. After that we moved across town to 309 N. Humphreys where I lived there with my parents until I returned from the service and was married and lived in my own home, which was then on 415 N. Kendrick. We built this home in 1950 and I've lived here ever since.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. Okay, do you want to tell me a little bit about your parents' background?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: My mother was the superintendent of schools in <New Mexico>, <Deming New Mexico>, when my father married her in 1910. And Dad was- came here with Mr. Dolan in the lumber business, and he was millwright for the <Flagstaff> Lumber from about 1910 until about 1920. After which he sold his interest in the sawmill and went into private business as a carpenter and contractor.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, and what was your mother's maiden name?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: My mother's maiden name was Nancy Tyman Bergen.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: And, ah, she, ah, came out from <Indiana> to teach in <Deming New Mexico> and that's, ah, how my, ah, parents became acquainted, was in <Deming>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, and then what was your father's full name so I'll have it down?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh, my father's full name was Peter Joseph Lindemann, Sr.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Now did he know, ah, Dolan in <New Mexico>?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yes, he was acquainted. The Dolan family of Mahoneys and Clarks had interests in <Deming New Mexico> and that's how the two men became acquainted. My father came to <New Mexico> from <Wisconsin> by the route of Panama Canal and <San Francisco>, and, ah, my father actually homesteaded, ah, in southern <New Mexico>, or south of <Deming>, between <Deming> and <Columbus>, which is the border town south of <Deming>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh Huh, Okay, and what are some of your impressions of the Dolans, or Mr. Dolan in particular?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh, he was a very dynamic sort of a person. Ah he did a lot of good things a lot of people didn't know. He was a good businessman. And he was very shrewd and a sharp individual, a good business man, did a lot of charity that a lot of people didn't know, like lot of wealthy people they do a lot of kind things that they don't want anybody to know about.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember any particular incidences that he did?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Ah, this would be ah, of course, related to schools and things like that. You know as small kids, we a lot of times didn't always have the best of balls or the best of stuff, and he would see that we- they were delivered, or something like that you know. Here they come, you don't know who they come from, but you generally eventually, you find out. These are the sorts of things, kind things and I'm sure a lot of people that needed finances for help, too.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, now where did you go to school?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Well I went my- I went to St. Anthony's school, which was a parochial school which is now called Nativity. But, I went for eight years there at St. Anthony's, which was there at the corner of Cherry and Humphreys St. And I'm a Catholic by faith and so it was a Catholic school.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, and then what church did you go to?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: The Nativity Church, which later on the school was named after.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay uh huh. Can you tell me a little bit about how the nuns taught you at that time?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Well, of course there was discipline I would say. I feel that you walked the straight and narrow, and generally there weren't so many in the classes like they are now days so you got pretty much of individual attention. I think there was only about six boys in my eighth grade class.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Ah, in some cases you had both grades, like say seventh and eighth, fifth and sixth, third and fourth, because the classes weren't so large that you could have both.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh Huh. Well did you usually walk?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh yeah, sure we walked from 23 S. Agassiz. That was the nice thing about going to school, you got to go through downtown, alleys, and up River de Flag.

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs)

PETER J. LINDEMANN: And I don't know of any trash barrel or anything else that I hadn't looked in at one time or another.

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs)

PETER J. LINDEMANN: And, oh we walked by grocery stores and all that sort of business, pool halls and things like that. It was- and we usually had other children that walked with us. I mean, but there was never any threat or danger what time of day or night you'd walk through town.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, is your house on S. Agassiz still there?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yes, a family by Martinez live in it. It ah, it's in good repair. I've been- of course, they had a fire a while back, but they're working on it.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, and can you describe that St. Anthony's building to me? Tell me a little bit about it?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Well, of course it was built before my time, and the- it was built in sections. The back section held the- was the retreat for the nuns, where they had their quarters and all that which was off limits to all students and everybody unless. You went in the parlor. Then it had two wings. On one side, the facing south, the right wing, you started out with your second and third grades and then there was another room. Fourth and fifth and fifth and sixth was up above, on that. Now in the other wing was the kindergarten. And the Mexican-American children, to try and get them to speak the language, or the English. And then above the classroom was the seventh and eighth, and then across- well then that formed a court yard, and then across in front of the courtyard was the church, which was the Nativity church and then underneath it was the school hall or church hall. So the whole complex included the school, the church and the whole bit. And then the priest home was faced on Beaver Street and was east of the school.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. Okay, can you kind of tell me about a typical day in your childhood? Did you have, besides going to school; did you have special chores you had to do at home? Did you-

PETER J. LINDEMANN: I had oh, generally we'd take off to school. I think school started at about 8:30 or 9:00. And we would usually wait for when the snow was on the ground. Ah, this was before I was in school, but my brother would uh- the Dolans lived over by the mill, over at Flag Lumber Mill, and they would come by with their horse and sled in wintertime with the snow on the ground. And then when the weather was dry, they had their surrey and horse drawn wagon or surrey. By the time I was in school that had- the Dolan family had moved out during school time. And so I of course generally walked and do cross the tracts and then up San Francisco St. and maybe cut through Babbitts' store, and then out through by the packing plant, which was behind Babbitts', and then cut across by Dr. Miller's old office, and then then by Lee Doyle's and maybe down the alley and then up by Babbitts' old home there where the library is today, and then across to school. And back, I may go west and hit River de Flag and back down through under the bridges. And by Emerson school and on down under the railroad tracks and off until, oh down around probably Leroux where Leroux and the river crosses there, then cut off and go down Cottage or Phoenix Avenue.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. On these wanderings on the way home, did you run into any particular adventures?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh, you know that was during bootleg days, and we- the wooden bridge there about where, oh where Santa Fe is- see Santa Fe street of Santa Fe Avenue, there, there used to be a wooden bridge there, a foot bridge. And we'd find, oh Canned Heat and stuff like that that they'd squeezed the alcohol out to drink. And that was of course, probably that was bad business, but it always burned nice, you know. That- it's kind of got a clay material in it that the alcohol was in that you squeeze it out, and what they had left over you'd put a match to it and it would burn. But other than that, I mean, it's just routine kid's life, you know. You don't ah, nothing real exciting happens. You didn't get kidnapped or chased or anything like that.

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs)

PETER J. LINDEMANN: You might have broke a window some place or threw a rock at a cat or a dog or gotten in a scuffle or something like that, throw snowballs was usually it if there was snow around. It was pretty routine.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you used to play around the tracks quite a bit, or was that more or less forbidden?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Generally no. We didn't mess around the tracks too much 'cause we'd see these locomotives go up and down there and we pretty well- our parents pretty well indoctrinated us about staying away from it. And it was just dangerous is all, and I think most kids are smart enough to be aware of danger no matter what their age is.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, would you tell me a little bit about the down town area that you remember in those wanderings back and forth?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Well the- of course, Front Street was about the same. They had some canopies over the street, which they have a couple of now down there, but the Black's Bar or Club 66 as it is known today was there. And then there was a restaurant next to it called Bender's Restaurant which- and then newsstand which- owned- Mr-. I can't think of his name right now, ah Brown, Mr. Brown ran the newsstand, and prior to him a man by the name of Hawk had it. And there was a grocery store in there, and then the Commercial Hotel, and then there was a Chinese Restaurant down from the Commercial Hotel. It was about the only Chinese Restaurant we had at that time. And then a curio shop on the corner across from the Bank Hotel. And around the corner there was, oh candy shop and a drug store, and then you get down to where Bledsoe's is presently located. There was a dry goods store and right on around the block kind of the same thing.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: About the only exciting thing is, about in 1924 that whole corner burned down, the corner where- oh from the Commercial Hotel west, and then north to the parking lot where the, where the city parking lot is. (Interrupted by doorbell--"whoo, got to go".)

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, Mr. Frank Conrard has just walked in and so I'm going to introduce him. And he was born in Milton in 1904, and has lived in the <Flagstaff> area ever since, and his profession is a house painter, though he is now retired. Okay, Mr. Conrard, do you want to tell me a little bit more about where were you born?

FRANK CONRARD: Ah, do you know where the Golden Star is?

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: Well right across the street was where.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

FRANK CONRARD: From the- ah, where the- ah, what is it- the, ah, the drive in, the Highway House, the-

SUSAN ROGERS: Holiday Inn, right in there?

FRANK CONRARD: No, there's a car wash there right now, oh yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, fine.

FRANK CONRARD: And, ah see the city limits was just the other side of where you turn to go do the college, and that was Milton from there on.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

FRANK CONRARD: So it was <Flagstaff>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, but when-

FRANK CONRARD: About was- it's part of <Flagstaff> now.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, but when did it become a part of <Flagstaff>? Do you know, or when was it stopped being called Milton? Not very long ago.

FRANK CONRARD: Beg pardon? (dog barks)

SUSAN ROGERS: Not very long ago, was it.

FRANK CONRARD: Oh, it's been quite a long while. They used to after Milton, you see. It was named after John Milton. English- was the poet, English poet?

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh yeah, uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: Then everybody started calling Mill Town because that's where the sawmill was.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh Huh, uh huh. Okay, can you tell me a little bit on your parents' background? Where were they from and how they met?

FRANK CONRARD: Well, that really don't know. My mother was born in <Ireland>, and my dad was born in <Dodsonville Ohio>. It's out of <Cincinnati> some place.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, and then how did they end up in <Flagstaff>?

FRANK CONRARD: Well, I guess my uncle came out here, and was out here, and I guess he got a job or something and my dad came out here as the master mechanic at the sawmill and stayed there until 1912.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: What sawmill, Frank?

FRANK CONRARD: Arizona Lumber and Timber.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, when you say he stayed there 'til 1912, then did you move somewhere else?

FRANK CONRARD: In 1913, we moved down to <Flagstaff> mill.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, and then where did you live?

FRANK CONRARD: Well we moved to where the Peak (?) house is now.

SUSAN ROGERS: All right, what street?

FRANK CONRARD: On, ah, Birch.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, what's the address, do you know?

FRANK CONRARD: No, I don't.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

FRANK CONRARD: It would be at 300.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, fine.

FRANK CONRARD: And then moved to where I live now in 1914.

SUSAN ROGERS: And where's that?

FRANK CONRARD: On 615 W. Cherry.

SUSAN ROGERS: And you've lived there ever since. Did you build that house or did you buy it?

FRANK CONRARD: Dad bought it, and we moved there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, now ah, let me ask you a little bit about Milton. Do you remember the life, your life there very much?

FRANK CONRARD: Well, quite a little bit.

SUSAN ROGERS: Can you tell me a little bit about your daily activities, about your neighbors, a little bit?

FRANK CONRARD: Well, quite a little bit.

SUSAN ROGERS: What the houses looked like?

FRANK CONRARD: Well, the one I was born in was a big two story house set, I guess it's still over there some place close to the railroad track.

SUSAN ROGERS: It's been moved? Where?

FRANK CONRARD: Uh huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: But it's still around?

FRANK CONRARD:

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: We just played around, and we had all the room in the country to play out there. Well, up where the Riordan house is, that was part of our playground.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: Used to go up there if they weren't down at our house, we were up there, or some place else in that same neighborhood. It was always a small neighborhood, and everybody was just friends and neighbors all the way through.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh Huh. Now did you know the Riordans?

FRANK CONRARD: Oh, yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: Can you tell me about them?

FRANK CONRARD: Well I guess they- I don't know, they come here from <Chicago> and D.M. Riordan, who was a half brother to Mike and Tim, was the Indian agent over at <Fort Defiance>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: And he- then he came out here and I guess Mike, I mean Tim, came out first. And they got the Riordan from a fellow by the name of, Ed Ayers, he's the one who built it. And so the story goes, that he got ready to leave and he told them he'd sell the mill for $250,000.00. If he ever got the money, it was all right with him. He was going to leave out, and they could have it. And then there was- well there- let's see, Blanche and Art and Bob and Claire and Dick Riordan.

SUSAN ROGERS: And you played with them?

FRANK CONRARD: Uh Huh (coughs). See I know where Dick lives. He lives out in here some place.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yes.

FRANK CONRARD: Claire lives in <Ireland>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: I guess Blanche is still here.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: That's of the Mike Riordan family. There’s another family of Riordans.

FRANK CONRARD: Then there's Tim Riordan; that was Mary and Anna. And I guess Mary and Anna died somewhere, I mean, Anna and Art Riordan died about in just two days with polio. And Mary just died not too long ago.

SUSAN ROGERS: Mm hmm.

FRANK CONRARD: They have several- Mary has several children, I guess. I mean grandchildren.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Well, Mary had three children by Bob Chambers.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: And it was Helen, Rita and Mary, I believe. There's three girls.

FRANK CONRARD: I didn't know any of them, 'cause we left up there, and they were not born (?).

PETER J. LINDEMANN: More my age than yours, they were.

FRANK CONRARD: (inaudible)

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah, the parents were closer to being your age than mine.

FRANK CONRARD: Well no, Bob's quite a older than I and Mary was, Mary was quite a lot older than I was. I know she was in her eighties when she died.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Mary? (?)

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, now did you used to go into their house?

FRANK CONRARD: Oh, yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: Could you describe it to me a little bit?

FRANK CONRARD: Well let's see. It's been so long since I was in there.

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs)

PETER J. LINDEMANN: That's a hard house to describe.

SUSAN ROGERS: I bet.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: 'cause it's two homes with a billiard room connecting it between.

FRANK CONRARD: And they are both identical.

SUSAN ROGERS: Both houses are, huh?

FRANK CONRARD: It was built in 1904 (coughs) and let's see, well when you walk in this big, oh I guess you'd say library, and then this big dining room and then this big hall (?) where the skylight is. Let's see it's been so long-

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah, I-

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: I've probably been there since you have, George, Frank. But it's still- you have a big entry way, then you, your library and sitting room, then the dining room and kitchen, and all that on the first floor. The living quarters are- I mean their room’s _______ upstairs.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

FRANK CONRARD: It's quite a house, though.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah. When did it burn? I remember Dad doing some replacing the roof on it years afterwards.

FRANK CONRARD: Well, that was over on the Mike Riordan's.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Was that Mike Riordan's side?

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah. That was, oh I don't know, that must have been-

PETER J. LINDEMANN: About twenty, twenty-one, wasn't it?

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah, something like that. Of course Tim's place had that smoke trouble.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: (laughs) Yeah.

FRANK CONRARD: That was the last time I was in there.

SUSAN ROGERS: What happened to it?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: They had built a- they were coming home, and they had their caretaker to build a big fire in the furnace. And what happened is that the flue some how got plugged up and all this pitchy smoke went throughout the house.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, gosh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: And Frank had the job going in and re-decorating it.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah, got a kick out of Eric Bailey was sitting there. They were taking pictures , good old McCauley (?)

PETER J. LINDEMANN: McCauley (?)?

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah, and I was doing something upstairs. They hollered at me and says come down and I'll show you a picture. Do you know anybody in this picture? And I knew Holly (?), and I was standing there with Holly (?) all dressed up for some kind of party.

SUSAN ROGERS: That's what I was going to ask you. Were there quite a few big parties up there at that house?

FRANK CONRARD: Oh, yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you go to any there, or did you used to go somewhere else?

FRANK CONRARD: No, we were just kids parties by this time (?), 'cause we left there when we were just kids.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: And I attended some up there, but it was mostly the grand kid’s party. You know, like with Helen and Rita and Chambers was when they were. A real blowout, no, I never been to a real blowout.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

FRANK CONRARD: Some place around the house they had a menu that they had the parties up there. Screwball outfit, like they had a pine knots and all kinds of stuff like that.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh, boy.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay and then where did you attend school?

FRANK CONRARD: Ah, I went to the eighth grade at St. Anthony's.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, now is this where you became friends?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh no, no. We, it was through our parents we became friends.

SUSAN ROGERS: Became friends. Okay, okay. Yeah, you went there ahead of him, I assume. Okay and he described that a little bit to me so I don't think we need to do anymore on that. Um, let me ask each one of you, ah how many brothers and sisters you have, and their names, and where they are now.

FRANK CONRARD: Well, I had- there was eight of us in the family, four boys and four girls. And there's five of us still living.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh, okay.

FRANK CONRARD: And three of us living here and two in <Phoenix>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

FRANK CONRARD: Two sisters living in <Phoenix>, and one sister living here.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, now do you want to tell me what the sister's married names are, just for the record?

FRANK CONRARD: Well, the one living here is Rose Yates, and the one in <Phoenix> is Mary Hall, and the other is Mary Kathleen (?) Connor.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh, and how about you?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: I had a sister that died shortly after birth, which would have been the oldest one in the family. My brother was born in about 1914, and he's Mike, Michael , and he lives in <Fresno> or <Sanger California>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: And then myself. Just the two boys actually.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, okay, when you were kids do you remember any big, special celebrations? Maybe some of the early Pow Wows, Fourth of Julys, maybe something at Christmas?

FRANK CONRARD: Oh, we always had Fourth of July celebrations.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

FRANK CONRARD: That's when the fair grounds over where South Beaver school is, around in that area. And that was at a, oh it was just a rodeo, Indian dances and Indian horse races and foot races, and things like that.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah. I think the first gathering I remember I think was a church picnic, was at- held out close to the reservoirs out here by where Flagstaff Country Club- out there, and, gee I was probably only about four or five. And then the next big gathering that brings to mind is when they dedicated the second big reservoir out there. The ah, Mr. Koch, I.B. Koch, was mayor at the time, and I was, I think about eight years old, and that would be about- or ten. About 1926 or 27 was when that was dedicated.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: And us kids got served ice-cream cones, and we waded in the water as it come into the reservoir in the bottom. We were down and they had it so you could get down in the bottom of where the water came in. And then referring to the Pow Wow, well, the Elks were really the people that I remember of starting Pow Wow. They had grew their long beards and things like that, and then they had the stockade. The one I remember, they had the stockade down at the- about where the Babbitts' garage and used car lot there, and part of where the post office is.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: And they'd put up slabs- railroad log slabs, and make a stockade out of it, and you went and came, and went through a gate you know, where and whether you'd charge you or not, I don't remember that. But then they had all sorts of, oh booths, not booze, but booths. I imagine there was plenty of booze out there.

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs)

PETER J. LINDEMANN: But they had gambling and ah, things were pretty wide open really. And they'd get old burlesque shows, oh traveling burlesque, and the sword swallowers, and a real carnival atmosphere then.

FRANK CONRARD: Jitney Dance (?)

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: What's that?

FRANK CONRARD: Jitney Dance (?)?

SUSAN ROGERS: What's that?

FRANK CONRARD: It cost you a nickel a dance to dance, nickel a dance.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Grab your girl, pay them a nickel, go on and dance, you know. The girls weren't for hire especially. You had to pay for instance, to get, just rather than buy an evening ticket you'd pay so much a dance. That's why they call it a jitney dance.

FRANK CONRARD: Lake Mary we used to have jitney dances, so-

PETER J. LINDEMANN: That, and I mean that, and then it gradually people like Jack Fuss, and some of them brought in more of the Indian atmosphere, and it eventually went from a rodeo and wild west and frontier days into the Pow Wow. Is basically how the attrition went.

FRANK CONRARD: Jack was one of the instigators of the Indian, All Indian Pow Wow, Jack Fuss.

SUSAN ROGERS: Yes.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Have you interviewed him?

SUSAN ROGERS: Right, uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Well he's a great individual.

SUSAN ROGERS: He sure is. Okay, um let's see, did I ask about your neighborhood down there? How many houses were around you?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: We had, that was a pretty well built up part of <Flagstaff> at that time.

SUSAN ROGERS: At that time.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: That's down on South Agassiz and over towards Flag Lumber. And then they had the Brannen Church over there, which was the Catholic Church over there. And that was, the really, the built up part of town. And then gradually as the north side built up, the business and everything like that, well then they started moving up towards the hill and further out. But, gosh, the furthest out probably there was a house, was probably foot of Columbus and Beaver Street, about the furthest house out.

FRANK CONRARD: And let's see, Tom Burkett (?)

PETER J. LINDEMANN: San Francisco there was his house. L or

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: So, they weren't- and it mostly- they were Anglos, and Mexican American. And see we didn't have any Negroes, many in <Flagstaff> until about 1928 when the Cady Lumber Co. bought out the Flagstaff Lumber, and then they brought the black people in carloads, in freight cars. And then the Depression struck us and these people were better off in <Flagstaff> than they would to going back to the south, where they at least, they had schools and things like that.

END TAPE 1, SIDE 1, BEGIN TAPE 1, SIDE 2

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, You were saying a little bit about the blacks. When they brought them in those carloads, did that cause any problems to the community?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: I would say <Flagstaff> was very much of a- we’ve had very few Ku Kluxers. We've had very few racists, I'd say. We were really- we assimilated them quite well. In fact, at the time there was a state law that up through grade school they had to have their own school for the blacks, so they built the school there at Dunbar School, which is now the center over there. And then, when they got to high school, they went right there with the rest of us. We had very little religious or racial conflict and I've always been proud of <Flagstaff> for that.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, and you said that also-

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Don't you think, Frank? I-

FRANK CONRARD: I don't-

PETER J. LINDEMANN: I mean-

FRANK CONRARD: I don't think there's ever been any real race problems. Of course when we were kids, why, when we was going to school, we'd always run the Mexicans home.

SUSAN ROGERS: That's what I was going to ask about, the Mexicans next.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah, well it's depend on whether you lived in a Anglo area or a Mexican area. I mean I got run home by Mexicans too, so I mean it'd kind-

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs)

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Of depends on who teamed up, so I mean, I think it was pretty much where we pretty well, especially going through. Well our schools had a lot of Mexicans. Nativity wasn't or St. Anthony wasn't 'specially a school for the- there were poor Mexicans and poor whites and everybody else in that school then.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: That's where I started to school was St. Anthony's.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: You started in first grade there, Frank?

FRANK CONRARD: Well, you know where the, that health food store is?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh that, yeah, there at the corner of Cherry and Humphreys, yeah.

FRANK CONRARD: Well, that set over in the school lot there and that was the school.

SUSAN ROGERS: Really, I didn't know that. And they moved that building over huh?

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah, they moved that building across the street.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: And there was all eight grades in there.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Well, then you saw the advent of the construction of St. Anthony's school when the nuns, ah (coughing)

FRANK CONRARD: The nuns part was already built.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh.

FRANK CONRARD: And ah, no we were, I wasn't here when we'd already gone back to <Cincinnati> for a visit. And we were gone for oh, seven or eight months. And then we got back, why they'd moved it and St. Anthony's was built.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Mm. When was the church put on the front of it then, or was that all part of the same construction?

FRANK CONRARD: That was the whole construction, the whole construction.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Mm.

FRANK CONRARD: That was built for just amount of time. I was able to . It was built in 1911.

SUSAN ROGERS: Why did they move so many houses around? Seems like a lot of the houses were moved around. Any particular reasons that you know?

FRANK CONRARD: Well, I think a lot of it was the houses were good, but they wanted to build something else on the lot, and they just moved the house, too. People there, are several of them out there in East Flag that used to be in old <Flagstaff>.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Uh huh, or the same way up by the hospital. Some of them moved up there, too.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: And they didn't have planning and zoning and restrictions, and so they could move them around pretty well. There's one down here on Sitgreaves that was over on the other side of the tracks. There that, ah there at the corner of Sitgreaves and Phoenix. That one that Gus Dillman(?) moved over.

SUSAN ROGERS: I was going to ask a little bit more about minority groups while we are talking about that. Were there any Indians living in town at that time? Or when- how did they start coming in from the-

FRANK CONRARD: Well, they used to, they used to come in all the time and , too. And they'd do a lot of their shopping in town. See if they couldn't buy whiskey, get a little firewater . While we was talking about this, up there where we lived was a railroad right up to the sawmill. And on the other hill in between there wasn't hardly anything. And you'd see them out there putting on a dance. They was in the nude putting on a dance out there.

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs)

PETER J. LINDEMANN: But we never had to- we didn't have any Indians in school to my knowledge. Ah, a lot of the Hopi women came in and worked as house, as maids, and things like that. And they were really, I would say the first working force that came into <Flagstaff> of the Indian race, other than maybe some laborers, and I didn't know too many. But the Hopi women made real good housekeepers and they still do, as far as that goes.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: Well, then they used to bring in every summer, they'd bring in a bunch of students from out at (coughing) different schools, from out at <Leupp> and <Tuba>, bring them in and they'd- ah, as a just around the house . We had one Mary Gray (?) I think her name was. She was about, oh fifteen - sixteen years old.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: She just- get them for just pretty near nothing, and do housekeeping and help around the house. That's about all they'd did.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: 'Course they learned the language, the English language a lot better too.

FRANK CONRARD: Oh yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: I mean this was part of-

FRANK CONRARD: Every weekday, I mean once a week, probably all the ah, I guess you'd say supervisors, from out from all the schools would come in, and they'd have a day off, and they'd take care of them, took them downtown and buy whatever they wanted.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh Huh, uh huh. Okay, well what about the Chinese and this old town. Were they going to school with you?

FRANK CONRARD: Oh, some of them. 'Course I don't really remember any Chinese going over here, like Wong June, 'course he was-

PETER J. LINDEMANN: But they lived in the same block we did, the June family. There was Junes and the Lindemanns, and the Nackards, and right on down the line there. And ah, ah, of course dad did a lot of work for Junes, in construction work, building and stuff like. They had the laundry, the American laundry.

SUSAN ROGERS: Mm, mm.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Or the American Laundry, yeah, and they had quite a large family, all outstanding students. And there's quite a few of them still here in Flag, family, grandkids and stuff.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: So, no there was never- and then there were a couple in there. There was the Judge Woo. The Woo family that had a restaurant down on ah, well the first one I knew of was probably there on Front Street some place.

FRANK CONRARD: wasn't it? There was two of them on Front Street there. Three of them, I guess. One there by where the Rose Tree is.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Well, that was Bender's wasn't it? It was before Bender's.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah, oh remember, next door, this side was where Bender had his restaurant.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh, is that right?

FRANK CONRARD: He had a restaurant around where, oh in back of the Club 66.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh, uh huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: Bender did, or a Chinese?

FRANK CONRARD: Bender.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Bender. Then he moved around on the front, too.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: He moved around front. He first started behind the Black's Bar, and then moved around to the west side of Black's Bar, and that's the way it worked.

FRANK CONRARD: Right next door to the Rose Tree.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: The Rose Tree. And Nackard had the pool hall around where the, where the bar is now called the , the- what bar is that, across from Black's Bar? Nackard had a pool hall there, K.J. Nackard.

FRANK CONRARD: Oh, that was, that was the New York store.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: New York store.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah, the New York store.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah.

FRANK CONRARD: The- let's see what was it? About 1926, he built where the Nackard building is.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: And put the new post office right in there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. Okay. Where did you do most of your shopping? Did do any like on South San Francisco St.?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Miers had a store on S. San Francisco St. There was kind of a corner grocery store, and ah, but generally we came across to Babbitts’ or Brooks store. There was a Mrs. Brooks that had a, or Mr. Brooks and Mrs. Brooks out on Santa Fe, there by the Park and Santa Fe, and they did bottling works, too. But we, they had a grocery store, and I would say probably, most of our shopping was done with Babbitts'.

FRANK CONRARD: Well then there's- then let's see, well these are just some of the stores that were down there then.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: There was Hick's across the street from Babbitts’, which was a grocery store.

FRANK CONRARD: Well there's- let's see, Black and something Black, and then Joe Crawford.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah.

FRANK CONRARD: He had the store there where, where the movie used to be, right next to Bledsoe's.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Well Hicks had one in there, too, down just a couple of doors from there, too. Then there was Crawford. Didn't he have the one on Front St., too, for awhile?

FRANK CONRARD: No, that

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Who was the-

FRANK CONRARD: What is his name?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Had eventually went into liquor. Had the liquor store there where, where the newsstand is now.

FRANK CONRARD: Harkey had grocery store down in front.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Granddad Harkey.

FRANK CONRARD: He had to give (?) it up in later years.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah, oh yeah. You're talking ten years before I can remember, Frank.

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs)

PETER J. LINDEMANN: You can tell about the theater there, too. Wasn't the theater there?

FRANK CONRARD: Well, there was Babbitts' men's shop was there. Then there was the theater and also Babbitts' garage.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: That's right there between, well Sprouse Reitz is right next to it there if you want to locate it present day.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh Huh. Okay, and did they bring in movies now or any entertainment, or what? L or

FRANK CONRARD: Movies.

FRANK CONRARD: And that was called The Majestic.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Was that the name of the-

FRANK CONRARD: Then, of course, there was the Orpheum down where it is. It caved in in 1915, '15 or '16, which one that is?

SUSAN ROGERS: '16.

FRANK CONRARD: '16?

SUSAN ROGERS: We have a picture of it.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: That was about 6:00 in the morning or something like that. It was down-

FRANK CONRARD: People down there and they'd gotten out at midnight. (dog barking) 'Course around there on Front Street where the, oh what do you call it?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: The GAR building on the corner of Santa Fe or Front Street and, oh Beaver Street was the little building there when I was probably six. One of the first things I remember, one of the things I remember going to school, and they tore it down to put a service station in there.

SUSAN ROGERS: So was that the north west corner?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah, no, no north.

SUSAN ROGERS: Northeast?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Northeast corner.

FRANK CONRARD: Southwest corner GAR, where the GAR is (?).

SUSAN ROGERS: Where the Chamber of Commerce office is now?

FRANK CONRARD: No. It's across the street this way.

PETER J. LINDEMANN or FRANK CONRARD: The s-

PETER J. LINDEMANN or FRANK CONRARD: Yeah.

FRANK CONRARD: The southwest corner of the block.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah, well they had White garage in there, too, see-

FRANK CONRARD: Well, the White garage was right across the street.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah, but you are on the wrong side of the street.

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs)

FRANK CONRARD: Huh?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: You are on the wrong side of the street.

FRANK CONRARD: No.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: It's on the east side of the street where that GAR building was, as you come down toward Frank Bennett's.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah, that’s right. And then next to that was Marlar Hall.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: I didn't know.

FRANK CONRARD: It was a dance hall.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Was it?

FRANK CONRARD: Will Marlar was a- had a drug store here, but that was- I mean Knoles Bakery went in there later.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh yeah. That's right. I didn't know that was a dance hall in there though.

FRANK CONRARD: Yes.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Fred (?) had that J.P., or had that carpeting outfit-

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: Across from the other corner where the Corral is, the Camera Corral?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh, yeah.

FRANK CONRARD: That store there that used to be part of the opera house. That was a noted dance hall and-

PETER J. LINDEMANN: well when I knew it, well Harper's had moved from, he had his first second hand store over there on Phoenix Avenue just about on the corner of Leroux and Phoenix, actually where it was. And then he moved across again to that place that you are referring right now. The second hand store.

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah. Okay, um, you started to tell me a little bit about south San Francisco Street. Some students are doing research on that street, and they just wanted to know anything they can. Maybe some of the buildings, some of the people. How it got its reputation.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: One of the persons to talk to would be Mrs. Nieto.

SUSAN ROGERS: How do you spell that? Is that N i e t o?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Well-

FRANK CONRARD: I'd be real surprised if she'd want to talk to-

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah, that’s true too. Mrs. Nieto, her husband, see had a livery stable right next to Junes' where Junes' built their American Laundry.

FRANK CONRARD: That was not, not Fidel's. It was his dad's.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: His dad's, yeah, yeah.

FRANK CONRARD: Because, ah Fidel-

PETER J. LINDEMANN: That's Mrs. Nieto's ex, her husband, deceased now.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

FRANK CONRARD: He was I think younger than I am.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Fidel was.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah.

FRANK CONRARD: But-

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Victor or Fred Nackard ought to know about it, quite a bit about-

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah .

PETER J. LINDEMANN: South San Francisco, too. They- the first bootleg I ever bought was from Tex Wright, there right off of San Francisco there, just about a block from where I lived there. It was on Phoenix, not Phoenix, but Cottage Avenue.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah, those two little apartments there.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Those gray apartments there.

SUSAN ROGERS: How do you think its, it’s got the reputa, reputation that it has? Did that develop over the years or did it have that reputation when you were younger, kind of?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh, we didn't generally as kids get over on San Francisco.

SUSAN ROGERS: You didn't?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Ah, at night I mean we could go in and out or do exactly, because I only lived a block from San Francisco see, on Agassiz.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: And we'd go over there to Mier's or some place, and buy candy or stuff like that. But generally it was the red-light district as far as early time was concerned. At least this is what Fidel Nieto used to tell me that these fellows would leave their horses in the livery stable there at the corner of Phoenix and San Francisco, and then walk down into the district there. And it gradually deteriorated. Ah, I wouldn't say it's any worse or any better than it's been one way of the other. I think it's-

FRANK CONRARD: I think it's a little worse than it was then.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Well this is true. I think probably again is that the black people have more or less moved the Mexican Americans out of that area, and which again is- makes it a little rougher probably for policing and things like that, because their activities are sometimes a little more forceful or than maybe- they just express themselves more, probably.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh, uh huh, okay.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Not giving them or running them down or anything like that.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: They ah, what do they call that bar over there that's no place for a white man to go.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: No it isn't. I just had a friend in the office the other day that mouthed off in there. He was loaded to the gill, and he woke up in the hospital.

FRANK CONRARD: The name's Grande.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: El Rancho Grande, yeah.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: And yet it was originally Mexican.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh Huh, uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: But now it's pretty well taken over by the blacks and, of course, that old building across the street they tore down. They had an old theater in there. They've had a lot of things in that old building. Good thing to see it go.

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs) The only one building that should have been torn down, huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, you- I heard you mention about your buying bootleg and liquor. Do you want to tell me a little bit about the bootleg in the area? A wild tale or something?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh, I'm not, I was kind of on the very tail end of it, because, see that was-

SUSAN ROGERS: You were on the end?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Frank could tell you more, not that he did anymore drinking or anything like that.

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs) Okay.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Take the fifth, Frank.

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs)

FRANK CONRARD: there were plenty of bootleggers down there. There was one, Tex Wright and there was one ah, well it's where Nackard's liquor store was there on the corner. I don't know where it is now.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh then, uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: But, a long time ago over there and went in, I was going in. I'd had a little trouble with the cops over on the south side at one of the dances. They told me not to go over on the south side anymore. So, there was just a good reason for me to go over there. R and

PETER J. LINDEMANN: (laugh)

FRANK CONRARD: So I walked over and went into a bootleg joint and met- can't, can't think of his name, who was running it. So I went and it was old John Curley.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: And I went over there together. And we went in and Tex (?) walked up to John and says, "What do you want, John?" and John says, "Oh the same cup Cooper had over here this morning." Well Cooper's the chief of police.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Did he, yeah?

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs)

FRANK CONRARD: And then I went over there that night. I knocked on, just started knocking on the door. It opened and who was coming out, but Cooper. R and

PETER J. LINDEMANN: (laugh)

FRANK CONRARD: He told me I could go over on the south side any time I wanted, after that. R and

PETER J. LINDEMANN: (laugh)

FRANK CONRARD: Then there was bootleggers there, but they were the Westerner Hotel .

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah, oh that building right there. I was talking about the Canned Heat that you found underneath, where they'd squeeze the drippings out underneath that bridge.

FRANK CONRARD: (laughs)

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you know of anybody dying from drinking that kind of stuff?

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Well even when I was in school up here, we lost a student from drinking; had (?) died out there(?) Splinter City, out there behind the college there, out there in those cottages out there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Splinter City. Now what did that mean?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Well, they've really gotten rid it, it's those little cottages down there, you know those rock cottages down there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Cottage City?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Cottage City, yeah.

FRANK CONRARD: Cottage City.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: There used to be a Splinter City in that same area. After the war they had some barracks in there that was called Splinter City.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: But that was- didn't last only for a few years.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh, uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: Then there was George Elliott, was a bootlegger.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: He's the guy who carried the cane?

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: I picked that cane up one time. He was looking at a place of my father's. Damn near broke my arm, it was so heavy. He had a loaded cane, and he was crippled. But he had a cane. It was like a lead cane. And he could kill a man with it in a head swing. And I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't rap a few heads with it, or kill anybody I don't know.

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs)

PETER J. LINDEMANN: It was great, though, growing up in <Flagstaff>. You went through Flag High, didn't you, Frank?

FRANK CONRARD: No, I never finished the eighth grade.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: You went into interior decorating and exterior decorating and never finished school, right?

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Well it's all right.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, so did you- you went to the high school, huh?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: I went on through Flagstaff High and went through the college.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: I'm a product from the cradle to the grave in this community.

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs) Okay, do you want to tell me a little bit about the high school in those days?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah, we had about 250 students, and we had about twenty-four fellows that played football or anything else . We always had about the size of it. Had ah, we had some outstanding teachers. One by the name of Olive McNerney, who taught languages, and a very strict disciplinarian, and another by the name Rollie Wheeler, who has been mayor of <Flagstaff> and all that.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh, uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Was coach and very outstanding, and did a lot. I would say he did as much to form the lives of most of the boys and men that he came in touch with. As much as their fathers. At least I always felt that next to my father, that probably Mr. Wheeler had as much to do with shaping my attitudes and philosophy of life and everything like that.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Then there was a guy by the name of Bud Brown, the English teacher, who was a very likeable and quite an interesting individual. McVey was the principal and a fellow by the name of J.Q. Thomas, who was the superintendent. And the rest of them, well, I don't think I've left out any that’s worth mentioning.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Or somebody hears that, they'll say, "That's an opinionated son of a gun."

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs)

FRANK CONRARD: Well now, there was from what I hear, there was B.S. Kennedy was, when they first started the high school over in Emerson building. You see they had the first, second years over there.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah, well I didn't know. See I didn't start until up here. My father helped build the high school.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: And pretty near got killed in that, though.

SUSAN ROGERS: Really?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Mmmm.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, and then from there, you went straight on up to the college?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah. Started going across the tracks, the other way, see.

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs)

PETER J. LINDEMANN: As a childhood, I walked across the tracks to the grade school. So when I started going to the college, I walked across the tracks the other way.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: And I walked a lot.

SUSAN ROGERS: And then you lived at home?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh yeah, at 309 N. Humphreys, yeah I-

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah, I couldn't afford to. And we only had then about four to five hundred students up there, and very much of, we had personal care. And I'd say the university or college faculty was outstanding. Really, for as small a school as it was.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Ah, we had some some of, well our mathematician, a fellow by the name Butermun (?) was probably about the third or fourth smartest mathematician in the <United States>. And then they had Skidmore, and a lot of other fine people that taught in science. But I got a business and teaching degree from the university. Basically, my mother was dragging me into law, which I should have probably done.

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs) Okay.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Ended up into dentistry.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, let me ask you a little bit more about the school up there. Um, what were some of the big social activities, do you remember?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: The first function I remember going to school there. I was still living on South Agassiz. Mother took us over there, and we watched them play the Phoenix Indian School. And they was out in the rain and snow and mud out there on the McMullan (?) field there, which was behind where the old ladies, where the ladies' gym is today. It was down in- there's where they played.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: And then we used to go- Sousa came here with his band one time, and we went over to hear him play in the Ashurst Auditorium there. That was the biggest building in town, I guess. And I know we sat out in the beautiful afternoon, we sat outside and listened to him. We didn't go inside the auditorium. I don't know whether it was- if I handled my funds like my mother scrimped and saved, I would be a wealthy man today.

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs)

PETER J. LINDEMANN: But, ah and neither (?) the first, and then I went to school. That was the first school I went to was kindergarten.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh you did?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Over there at the old- well it's where the news office is.

SUSAN ROGERS:

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah, in the one with the beautiful pillars.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh, uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: And then I went to, started in St. Anthony after that.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, can you tell me what some of the rules and regulations on campus were at that time? Now, did you eat in the dining halls at all, or anything?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Very seldom. I mean, again, it meant, you could get your board and room I think for twenty-five dollars a month.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: But even at that, that was more expensive than living at home.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: And ah, I had no desire to live on campus. I had friends there that if I had wanted to spend the night up there, I could, but didn't even do that too often.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: And at home I had access to a car, which my dad would let me take occasionally, and that was part of it. Most of the town kids could get their parents' car.

SUSAN ROGERS: Right.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Most of the students on the campus were- this is a poor school. We- no one had any money.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: So, when our activities were more or less in that vein. Never did a great deal of drinking or anything like that. I mean at the school functions, by the time I was there in '36, '35, ah you could buy liquor. But it was just the money. No one had any money. The Depression pretty well- we were lucky to be in school.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh, uh huh. Okay, did you have any particular places where the students kind of hung out, you know and drank their coffee and talked about their classes?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: There was that one right across from Campbell Hall there that was ah, little building there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: That, oh Pat Patterson ran it for awhile, and Jack Blair ran it. And it was kind of handed down from married student to married student situation.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Ah, Pat Patterson was one of our Board of Regents members, so he- Jack Blair is still in town in business and so- Before that Frank- where did they go?

FRANK CONRARD: Well, down there where, oh DeLap used to have his store, office equipment, there was a-

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh, you mean downtown, in downtown.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah, that was called the Candy Box, wasn't it or-?

FRANK CONRARD: No, Billy Barnes had it first, then Griff bought it, Griff's.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Griff's, I remember.

FRANK CONRARD: And around on Leroux.

END TAPE 1, SIDE 2, BEGIN TAPE 2, SIDE 1

SUSAN ROGERS: You want to say more about the downtown area?

FRANK CONRARD: Oh, then there was the, what they called the Turquoise Tea Room, and I don't know who owned it. That was there in the, ah-

PETER J. LINDEMANN: That's where the fire started wasn't it"

FRANK CONRARD: Right next door.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: What fire was that?

FRANK CONRARD: Fire that burnt that corner and burned and .

PETER J. LINDEMANN: I mentioned it earlier, just about the time Frank was coming in. That was about the only exciting thing that happened in those early twenties was that corner burned out.

FRANK CONRARD: I remember that they had ice cream and candy and just the regular fountain, along with candy and things. Used to be a lotta them hang (?) out in there. A fellow, Mahoney was, was running it, and I was working there at the time of the fire.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh, were you?

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Well how did that fire get started? Do you know?

FRANK CONRARD: Well, I don't know. I'd been working and Mahoney come in and told me to- he says "Why don't you take the night off, the night off?" So I went up to the university, got the girl friend and went to the show, and come back and stopped in there and went up to the university, and when I got back to about to where Food Town, ah, the fire whistle blew. It was on fire, it was set on fire.

SUSAN ROGERS: It was, huh?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Well, they said it started at the candy kitchen. I think everybody, every body just said, well the candy just boiled over, something like that.

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs)

FRANK CONRARD: No, it actually started next door.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh, did it? Well, George Wallers (?) on those buildings at that time?

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah, well Switzer had a curio shop in the corner when the thing burnt.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Or was- then he went into the hardware business, or was it a curio and hardware combination?

FRANK CONRARD: No, he had a drug store there.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Was it a drug store?

FRANK CONRARD: Then he ah, I think it went out of business and C.D. Richardson had the curio store up there. Tony was running it.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: .

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah, well it burnt clear around to the Commercial Hotel, and then it stopped right at the Commercial Hotel. And then the Commercial Hotel burnt couple of months ago, so-

SUSAN ROGERS: Come out even, huh. Okay, I was asking you about if you’d remembered any rules and regulations? Remember any of the rules for the girls you know?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh.

SUSAN ROGERS: In particular?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: They were supposed to be in by 10:00 on weeknights and maybe midnight on-

FRANK CONRARD: Be in when I was running round up there, they had to be in by eight.

SUSAN ROGERS: Really?

FRANK CONRARD: On weeknights and, and at eleven on Friday and Saturday.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: They got a little more liberal when they got to us, Frank. It was probably about ten, I think on weeknights and about midnight on weekends. And then those windows along the end of Campbell and in that area, they functioned pretty nicely. When you only had one patrolman on campus, well we usually was able to escort them in the back window.

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs)

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Where there's a will, there's a way, you know.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah. There was ladders around, too.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah. (laughs)

SUSAN ROGERS: I, I suppose if they got caught, though, they were really-

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh they got campused or something like that.

SUSAN ROGERS: Not too serious.

FRANK CONRARD: Or some of them. They'd, they'd expel some of them.

SUSAN ROGERS: They did after a couple of times, huh?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Dean Minnie (Lintz) was always- I don't know who the dean, and then Mrs. Beckwith was the-

FRANK CONRARD: Lady B?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Lady B, yeah. She was a great person.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Dean Minnie was pretty nice, too.

SUSAN ROGERS: Can you tell me a little bit about them?

FRANK CONRARD: Lady B was, she was, Mrs. Beckwith was her name. She was the ah, oh what do you call em? I don't know what you call em.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Housemother, I guess you mean.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah, housemother at Campbell Hall. She was pretty strict and she knew what was going on.

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs)

FRANK CONRARD: And if you ever got in, got in bad with her, well you was in bad. She- but if you got in good with her, you could stay pretty good. I know one night I was brought this Indian (?) downtown and brought this girl back up there to school. At that time another girl come out. And I don't know how it come up, but anyhow I was to go down town with one of these girls, but they had to ask Lady B first. So she went in and asked her and she said, ah, "Oh yes he's a nice boy. You can go with him." L and

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs)

PETER J. LINDEMANN: That's always nice to have them think that way about you.

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs)

PETER J. LINDEMANN: That's ah, about the first time I remember Frank, a cousin of mine by the name of Patty Moran (?) had gone out with you some and Marguerite.

FRANK CONRARD: No, it was Marguerite.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Patty I guess.

FRANK CONRARD: It was Ed.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh, was it Ed?

FRANK CONRARD: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: And of course the Conrards, there was, Eilene was in school with me, your youngest sister that's my, she went to school with me, in school there. So, Conrards and Lindemanns and the . A lot of families, some of them still around, not too many.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. Okay, can you tell me a little bit about your daily class schedule and activities? What did you do in kind of an ordinary day up at NAU? I guess the Teacher's College then, right?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah, oh it routine. I think about what you'd do today, teaching skills. I . The ah, they had, like I said an outstanding math and science department. Their industrial arts was good. Their education was, the department I think- liberal arts was at least the equivalent or as good as <Tempe> so- It didn't have university status, but it was still- the requirements were good. The English and speech department was quite high. Most of them had doctorates that were head of their departments. I can't say that there was anything out of ordinary.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, ah what about the actual classrooms, how much discipline? Did you feel like you had too much homework, just the right amount or what?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh, I never let that, a thing like that bothers me too much.

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs)

PETER J. LINDEMANN: So, ah the- I felt, there again, they knew what we could accomplish, and they kept us pretty well under disciplinary. I don't know of ever getting out of line much.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Because, well, you just didn't get out of line. I think in some respects, we were there to learn, and we had our fun, too, but- like our bonfires and our dances and things like that. But all in all it was still a good education.

SUSAN ROGERS: Can you tell me about those bonfires? How did that get started? Whether tradition when you were there?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: That probably started back in Frank's days.

SUSAN ROGERS: Can you remember?

FRANK CONRARD: I don't remember. No, it was, no they were doing that when I started running around up there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh they were, huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Well, they celebrated homecoming.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah, it started on homecoming. They'd go out, gather up everything they could find and have a big bonfire and kind of a rally to celebrate the start.

SUSAN ROGERS: Where was it usually held?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh, south of campus. There somewhere over by the football field, or some where in there. Down by the dairy, the old dairy they had on campus, or and ah, the year we built it, which would be fall of '35, we had a flat rack. And we went all over town and backed up to these outhouses and pushed them over on the flat rack, and away we'd be.

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs)

PETER J. LINDEMANN: And you know, you know over by Highlands. Now this is an area that I don't know whether anybody'd ever talked to you about Highlands, which was-

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: It was east, and between Flag Lumber and Sewer Canyon. Over there was a whole area of homes. Houses just like Milton, was for the ALandT mill, this was a housing project for the Flag Lumber. And eventually those were all torn down and stuff like that. But most of these areas had sanitary sewers and things like that, but they usually had an outhouse in back, so we- But if you knew the town well enough, which I did, well we, we'd just go out and just really rack them up.

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs)

PETER J. LINDEMANN: And I know the sheriff came. We got one big up, one from around the armory about a four holer, and the sheriff come looking for that. We had to move that the next day, because they had the sheriff out after us.

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs)

PETER J. LINDEMANN: They make a nice fire, and you'd clean up the problem, and so some of those'd still be standing today, probably, if we hadn't moved them out for them.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. What were some of the prominent clubs and organizations on campus at that time?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh, probably the prominent ones would be, say the Hiking Club, and then there were several in the voice departments, and things like that, which I, neither being a singer or a musician, wasn't really too involved in with.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Then you had your routine like Newman Club and other church groups.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh, uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: But no fraternities or sororities. Had a few honor societies, Letterman's Club, and I belonged to the language honor society, that Sigma Iota or something like that. But those were the only ones that were really of the Latin names, were mostly honor societies of the different fields of local art.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh, okay, since you went to school, though like you said, during the Depression, did the most of the students have odd jobs that they were doing, or how did they pay?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Well, they worked on the campus, and then they, a lot of them would work in the mines during the summer time or in other areas, and then they'd come back. We had a lot of students from Globe and <Miami> and <Bisbee> and <Douglas>, and of course your Phelps Dodge. Or they- of course even the mines weren't working very much either then, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: So, a lot of them worked on the campus like they do today for scholarships or things like that.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. Okay.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: I generally worked with my father during the summer for the state highway, or some job you know. Get $15.00 a week or something like that.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, let's move into a different area. Do you remember any big crimes happening when you were kids that stick out in your mind or even later? You know in the <Flagstaff> area?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: How about Peg Leg? Did you have any- did you know anything about him or was that before your time or?

FRANK CONRARD: No, he was a- (coughs) there I remember when Johnson shot him. He was ah, well I mean, he was harmless.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: This is what I always understood, that he was kind of an innocent man.

FRANK CONRARD: All he did was, he lived up here on the side of the Peaks.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: And he had a peg leg.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: Just a wooden leg.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: The wooden leg.

FRANK CONRARD: Wooden leg, like John Silver.

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs)

FRANK CONRARD: And he was up here on the mountain, and I don't know what happened, but anyhow they tried to catch him. He was always pretty elusive. And all he'd do was go in, and go in this ranch house, or that ranch house, and steal grub. Never did do anything that was really… 'Course no one knew anything about him. All they knew was "Peg Leg". That's all he was called.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh, uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: And Johnson, this Johnson, run on to him and shot him and everybody said it was in cold blood, and that was.

FRANK CONRARD: I'm going to correct you a little bit here.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

FRANK CONRARD: Should have an extra "r" in there, C o n r a r d.

SUSAN ROGERS: You kept looking at that, huh, seeing it over my shoulder. Okay, um.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Well I didn't know. Where I came across it was when Dean Eldridge had his museum out there where the present day Museum Club is. And it was actually a museum, and he had two-headed calves and all these oddities of nature, plus like, oh Peg Leg's peg leg was there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Really?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah, and I think at the time, it was Kit Carson had it in his window there. Kit Carson had a photographic studio on the south side of Aspen about across from Babbitts dry goods store, right straight across there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh, uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: And he was our chief photographer in our community. Ugly guy kind of. He had these, not warts, but these kind of these growths on the side of his neck and quite a character, though.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now is that how the Museum Club got its name?

FRANK CONRARD: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now how long was it ah, now what would you call it, a freak museum or something?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh, it was just oddities and things. It was a museum. It had all sorts of things. It had ah, Mr. Eldridge was quite a taxidermist, and there were all sorts of not only freaks, but other birds and all this that he'd gone to. And he opened this place up and it's basically the way it was except they converted it and taken all the birds and stuff out of the trees.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh, and what year was that about?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh it was opened in about 1931 or- (dog barks)

FRANK CONRARD: Or maybe before that.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah, thirty?

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: Well, ah-

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Well I went out in a biology class as a freshman in high school, so it's, ah was built then, so it was probably before that.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah, because Dean died just a short time after repeal.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: And they turned it over to a-

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Museum nightclub.

SUSAN ROGERS: It was turned into a nightclub right away?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah, uh huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, do you remember any other crimes now?

FRANK CONRARD: I can't remember.

SUSAN ROGERS: Nothing in particular, huh?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Now I don't remember any real shootings or anything like that. No shoot-outs down town, especially. A few killed in autos. That was the, about the time autos were getting four wheel brakes and things like that, and we had a few killed that way, but a-

FRANK CONRARD: One that was. Course I mean this was a long time ago. It was when Harry Nash killed Schwab.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: That's right that’s right. Buried him in the well.

FRANK CONRARD: Uh huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: Can you tell me a little about that?

FRANK CONRARD: That was, Schwab was a kind of salesman, and he came over and stopped here, and this Harry Nash hitched a ride with him. And when they got out east of town, well he killed him, and he brought him back into town, and ah, just had him in the back seat of the car covered up. And went to this rooming house, got a room and stayed there. The next day he went out west of town, and this fellow by the name of Beeson (?) was digging a well out there and he quit (?). And he just took a- got this guy and tied in this well, and he buried him, and he drove off. And they tried all over and then, of course, they didn't know what happened to him for a long time. Until this guy's wife wrote a letter wanting to know what happened to him. He supposedly left here, in <Flagstaff> was the last place she had heard from him . A fellow by the name of Bert Huffer(?) was just a young fellow, and they had what they called a town herd. People had cows and they'd take these cows, take them out in the woods some place and feed them all day, and then bring them back in, and do (noise distraction). And the wind was blowing like the dickens and they climbed down in this well. Some of it was three feet deep, and they saw the typewriter and dug it up, and they found the skull, and they traced it to this Nash. And he had, he still had the car, and he had the serial number chiseled off. I don't know what his use was, but anyhow they brought him in and convicted him. And Judge Jones was the judge, and he gave him seventy-five to one hundred years. And told him, he says, "I hope young man you'll be a better man when you get out".

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: He escaped. They finally caught him and turned him loose.

SUSAN ROGERS: Turned him loose?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now did, had Nash lived in town before, or was he also just travelling through?

FRANK CONRARD: I don't know too much about, I can just remember this part of the-

PETER J. LINDEMANN: He didn't know (?)

SUSAN ROGERS: He didn't know or anything?

FRANK CONRARD: No.

SUSAN ROGERS: He wasn't. Now what year was that about?

FRANK CONRARD: That was, I was probably about 18, 19 something like that.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: I imagine it was the early twenties, at least.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah, about.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Because I heard about it, but it was hearsay, though, for my part.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: But a- other than that I don't remember any real exciting times as far as the criminal element is concerned. We've never had too much in the community.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, ah-

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Tramps would get off the train every once in awhile, and come and ask for something to eat or something, but they'd ride the rails and away they'd go. <Flagstaff>, as cold as it is in the wintertime, we're not bothered too much with permanent residents.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: None of them ever came to the house and went away hungry.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: No. I don't think so.

SUSAN ROGERS: Really?

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: They were always fed.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did they used to do some work around the house then, or anything?

FRANK CONRARD: If you'd ask them, most of them would.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah, they would.

FRANK CONRARD: Most of them was, well there was tramps and then there was hobos. The hobo was usually a mechanic of some kind and he just wanderlust and just traveled.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: And he'd get in town, say like get here in <Flagstaff>, stop for a few days to get a little money, and he'd then just go catch a freight train and move on.

SUSAN ROGERS: Mm.

FRANK CONRARD: Hobo, of course, he was the one who didn't want to work, and he just bummed around.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Well ah, one of our outstanding men here in the community who I don't know whether you've run across his name was Weatherford; Weatherford Hotel was named after him. In fact it was his hotel and whether he built that or not. Did he build that?

FRANK CONRARD: I think he did.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: That was another fire that was started ah, and that was about in '36 or '37. And I watched that take off. It might have been earlier than that.

FRANK CONRARD: It was earlier than that.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Mother and I was standing across the street by the, by the Penney's store there when that guy was burning trash, and it went to that wood pile and up that wooden fire escape. Just- I could hardly believe it; it went so fast, and of course, that old dry wood. Away it went with the pitch.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: But he a built the road up to the Peaks; Weatherford did.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, can you tell me a little bit about that now?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Probably Frank- is drove with his racer. Did you ever race up there, Frank?

FRANK CONRARD: No, no.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: It was kind of competing with Pike's Peak was the idea I think.

FRANK CONRARD: I don't remember too much about it. In fact I've never been up it.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh, hadn't you?

FRANK CONRARD: Uh uh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh, we used to go up it. Start there at the foot of the Peaks and go right on up and pay a toll.

SUSAN ROGERS: That's as I say? How much do you remember?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Gee I have no idea. Dad worried about that.

SUSAN ROGERS: Somebody told me a dollar and that seemed-

PETER J. LINDEMANN: I think that was it.

SUSAN ROGERS: Terribly expensive for then.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Of course that was an expensive road, and it moved around on up the south side or the north side, and then, of course, you got into the snow, but it went clear up to the Doyle saddle up there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: And then you walked on up to the point. But once or twice they'd had timed races, seeing who could race to the top of the mountain fastest, and I thought maybe Frank might have.

FRANK CONRARD: No that was-

SUSAN ROGERS: And how many people would participate in that?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh, three or four, maybe a dozen or so, twenty cars, I don't know.

SUSAN ROGERS: And usually local people, or you mean people who came-

PETER J. LINDEMANN: No, from all over. So, but just a shame the road isn't still useable to a certain extent. It's a beautiful road, but the maintenance is so great and it's shale and the snow-

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: You can drive quite a ways, at least to the foot of Fremont saddle.

FRANK CONRARD: No, never went up it. You're not going to go Doyle saddle with out horse with you.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah, and that's another one, of course. Doyle's were here. They built that beautiful home at the corner of Leroux and, ah-

FRANK CONRARD: Birch.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Birch, yeah.

FRANK CONRARD: That was Lee Doyle.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Lee Doyle, yeah I imagine.

SUSAN ROGERS: That's been torn down, right?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah, and Babbitts' Thriftway's there now.

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah.

FRANK CONRARD: Built in 1910.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Was it built-

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you know Al Doyle?

FRANK CONRARD: Did I know Al Doyle? Al was Lee's father.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: I knew him slightly, not too well. Well let's see. There was Lena and Al. Al Doyle was Lee's brother, too.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh.

FRANK CONRARD: Al Doyle was the old man and then he had a brother Al.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Lee's the only one I knew, and of course his-

FRANK CONRARD: I didn't know him. I didn't know the younger Al, but I knew Lee all my life, practically because he used to work for one of the grocery stores. In the morning, he'd come around in the morning to take orders and then the afternoon he'd deliver the order with a team wagon. He'd come around on horseback in the morning and then in the afternoon he'd deliver it.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Or a sled in the wintertime.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: What happened to their family, now? Are they still in town, any of them?

FRANK CONRARD or PETER J. LINDEMANN: Huh?

SUSAN ROGERS: What happened to the Doyles? Are any of them in town anymore?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: They're all dead.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, they are?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Lovell. How did the Lovell family get involved with the Doyle family? Lovells were-

FRANK CONRARD: Ah, yeah.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: And they are still alive, a couple of them I think or, Winifred Lovell. They were my contemporaries.

FRANK CONRARD: Barney, Bernie, wasn't it? Bernie Lovell?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: Now, well I was working for Lee, and Mrs. Doyle come to me and asked me if I would drive her down to Canyon City. She wanted to talk to her brother so-

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Canyon City? Where's that?

FRANK CONRARD: Huh?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Where's Canyon City?

FRANK CONRARD: Black, Black Canyon.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh <Black Canyon>, oh, uh huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: And so I drove her down there, and on the way back she told me that's what she'd gone down for is to find out, talk to her brother about getting a divorce from Lee. The reason was, Lee was living in the old Alva (?) house. Lee and they were getting together too often.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh, and that's how they got mixed up with Lovells.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah. That’s how Mrs. Lovell got mixed in with them.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Well, then she married Lee and the Lovell kids lived with she and Lee.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah, Lee, I mean Mrs. Doyle went over to <California>.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Well then that house, then, just west of the Doyle home was- Judge Russell lived in that.

FRANK CONRARD: That was the Al Doyle.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Is that the Al Doyle?

FRANK CONRARD: That was the home.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: And then the corner house down below was the one that ah-

FRANK CONRARD: That belonged Aubineau.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah, Aubineau. That's, and then George, well he died.

FRANK CONRARD: George married Mrs. Aubineau.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah, George ah-

FRANK CONRARD: Walters.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Walters, oh was that Mrs. Aubineau?

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah, uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Well, at any rate it was George Walters then not the judge.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah, but that was Julius Aubineau. He had the well that corner where it burned down. That was his corner. He had a mercantile store there.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: He also had something to do with the water system or something didn't he?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Aubineau springs was named after him, or after his father. Or was it after he, or after his father?

FRANK CONRARD: After the, well see there was ah, the three. I think there was Paul and Julius and I don't know, but those were her boys. But this was named after the old man.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah. The Aubineau. They have a plaque out at the Historical-

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: There- that was Aubineau, one of the family, came over to help dedicate it a number of years ago.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh, uh huh, okay. Can you tell me a little bit more about the Weatherfords. Where they lived and what about his personality and-

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh, I didn't know him that well. I mean I knew who Mr. Weatherford was. It's kind of like knowing Mr. Pollock, you- my age, I knew the kids, but Mr. Pollock was kind of an individual, too, but did you know John Weatherford? Wasn't that his first name?

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah, John Weatherford.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah, Frank you might know him better than I did.

FRANK CONRARD: Well, I didn't know him too well, only- He was an old man. He had had a boy but ah, well he run the hotel quite awhile and then his boy came in and run it, but I don't remember too much about-

PETER J. LINDEMANN: He lived there in the hotel didn't he?

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Uh huh. That's a first, one of the first recollections I had of the hotel, is my mother was a member of the Women's Club here, and the Women's Club was serving Rotary, and that's where Rotary, Flagstaff Rotary, was first organized was in- well it wasn't first organized but, that was one of the first eating places.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Was underneath the Weatherford Hotel. In fact they organized in the basement of the St. Anthony Hall over there and Father Vabre was their first chaplain. And he was quite the- he was the priest at that time. Then Rotary met in the Weatherford and then when Women's Club got their building built on Birch or Aspen there, then they went down there. And I used to go along with my mother. And I'd help set the tables you know and I, gee I was just, I don't remember three or four when they were at the Weatherford Hotel. And then they moved from the Women's Club building to have their meeting then at the Monte Vista when the Monte Vista was built. And we stayed there until we moved out to the Afton House. So that's how we’ve only had about five places.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: That Rotary's ever met in <Flagstaff>, the Flagstaff Rotary Club, so- Frank, why don't you tell about building the Monte Vista Hotel that was-?

SUSAN ROGERS: Let me back track just for a second. Are there any Weatherfords around anymore, or did they leave?

PETER J. LINDEMANN or FRANK CONRARD: No.

SUSAN ROGERS: There aren't? They left or they're dead?

FRANK CONRARD: Ah well, old, the old man, John Weatherford died a long time ago and I don't know what happened to Hugh. He ah, I think he was over in <California> now and after he left here.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

FRANK CONRARD: He, ah-

SUSAN ROGERS: So, that's not liked owned by the Weatherfords' anymore or anything?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: No it's changed hands. I think the Paul Babbitts' own it now.

FRANK CONRARD: Mrs. ah Mrs. Hall-

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Did own, but she sold it.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah. She sold it to, ah-

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Babbitt Enterprises, I think.

FRANK CONRARD: No. Ah, to a Hall (?).

END TAPE 2, SIDE 1 BEGIN TAPE 2, SIDE 2

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, you want to tell about building of the Monte Vista?

FRANK CONRARD: I wasn't here.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh, was that when you were gone? Well I know my- we were still living on South Agassiz then. And I know Dad was quite ah, they had ah, it was Community Hotel, and they got out and sold shares, stock in it. And I think it was just in the last four or five years that the stock, that was bought up by one. But there was no dividends or anything. So one of the Sliphers finally bought it. But that was the big hole right there, was at Babbitts' on one corner, and then this deep hole, and then when they- then the post office ah, where was it? In a little building above that, and then it moved from there to the Nackard building, or did it go the other way? No, and then it went back to the Federal Building where it is, yeah. The old post office was in there where Singer Sewing machine is. There in that corner building. I hardly know what's in there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: There was, there was that Lad 'n Lassie, or whatever.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: That's right, that's what's in there.

FRANK CONRARD: The old post office is over there where that barber shop is when I was a kid. On the corner right across there, catty corner where the barber shop is.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh, was it in the bank building?

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah, where Valdis was, that was the post office.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh well. Was it the post office, and then it went and then they changed it to the bank, to the First National Bank, I think, or something like that?

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah, that was the one that . Riordans'

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah.

FRANK CONRARD: That's who.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: That was built in about 1929, the Monte Vista was, I think, or '28.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah.

PETER J. LINDEMANN:

FRANK CONRARD: I was either out of town- well, I was monkeying around.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah.

FRANK CONRARD: The Indian reservation, then <Ft. Defiance>, Tohachie (?) .

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Let me ask- you came about running for mayor, or some of those experiences?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh, well that’s kind of just a matter of- I ran for council in '48, was elected and then I retired for two years for some reason or another, and then I ran again in '52, something like that or '54. At that time, the one that got the most votes, was out of courtesy, was elected mayor by the other members, so that's how it came about-

SUSAN ROGERS: I see.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Being mayor. Then, about the only thing that ah- Oh, there was a lot of things that we accomplished, but what I felt was proudest was that I was the instigator of this annexation of all this land around <Flagstaff>. Because at the time, counties had no authority for planning and zoning or anything like that. And what was happening was that the City could control its growth within, within its City limits. But as soon as you got outside the City limits, well you were getting all sorts of substandard housing and stuff like this, So my position was, I was going to annex as much of <Flagstaff>. But I felt that <Flagstaff> could develop in the next century or whatever is left. So this is, ah- I took a lot of ribbing on it. But I tried to go to natural barriers, and I had a fine council that went along with it. And so this is why we annexed the area so there many so people- huge, it made <Flagstaff> City limits three miles out there. Well you've got pretty nice control over that three miles too, in all directions.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: And the rest of it was just a matter of- I didn't run for mayor again or- because I was in charge of developing the free holders so we could go under a charter form of government. And then, back, and then I came back in '60 and run again for council and then I went from there. So I’ve been in and out of City government for-

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: For about ten years.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, do you want to tell me what other accomplishments you feel like were done in those ten years, and maybe something that you that you failed at, or that the council failed at?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Well, I am, I regret the fact that we didn't get our recreation complex through. That was the whole purpose of the sales tax was to build a first-rate complex that could handle our public pools and public recreation area, and a convention center or a hall. And it was a matter of, probably, financially it would have cost the City probably little or nothing to what it would cost us today. Then the second stage would have been our ice skating rink, which would have been built adjacent to it. Then we would have ourselves in pretty good. As it is now, I feel sometimes the sales tax money is spent in a good way, but you have nothing to really pin point it with. If you had built this complex, you'd say "well that's what my sales tax dollar's done for me and my children and my community". Right now whether they've put in a curb or gutter or paved the street or something like that, you don't take it quite as personally as that's what my sales tax dollar did for us. And this was kind of a real disappointment to me. I thought that it should have been a but you can't go back and say, "well I told you so".

FRANK CONRARD: Well that was the sole purpose of the sales tax.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Basically, that and retirement of bonds, and you- and drainage and recreation. Well this was where the recreation was going to come in and we got out, and put a lot of our own personal money and things like that into the selling the sales tax to the people. And unfortunately, the mayor and I didn't see eye to eye on this. And he wouldn't support the recreation and he, himself, was a coach and an athlete and all that.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: It should have been a natural for him really. I meant I think he would have done himself proud to have had his name on something like that.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Unfortunately he wouldn't go along with it and of course, he carried enough influence; he shot it down.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: So, that's really what my biggest disappointment-

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh, I've lost a lot of battles and stuff like that, but any political job you don't feel disappointed, you just don't win them all.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh, uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Presently, I'm on the Board of Supervisors for the County, which is in- I'm getting my education in that field now.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: I always say, "well maybe someday I might go to the legislature, then I'd know the whole stair steps of city and county and state government".

SUSAN ROGERS: Right, right. Okay, were there any other accomplishments, maybe that you wanted to mention? Either then or on the Board of Supervisors now?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh, no. I've got three nice children and a nice wife and, ah the best day's work I ever did was when I married my wife. She was a girl from <Arkansas>, and I met her in <Kansas City>; married in <Kansas City> in 1943. Had three children, a son that's born in 19- oh, I better not tell the dates, I might get the wrong dates. Well the oldest one is 31, well let's see he was born in 1944, the next one was born in about 1948, and my daughter was born in 1950.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh, uh huh, okay.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: And I'm quite proud of them.

SUSAN ROGERS: And how did you end up being a dentist? Do you want to tell me a little bit about that?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: It's a family profession. I have several uncles and cousins that are dentists. And it's the kind of profession where they give you credit for not knowing anything when you get into a professional school. Then they teach you from scratch, all the- you need certain requirements to get into it. But then when you get there, they teach you what they- what you're supposed to know and how to do it. Because it's kind of a, you're a frustrated jeweler because you work with metal; you’re kind of a frustrated physician, because you deal with life and death; you're kind of a frustrated engineer, because you make bridges and spans, and you've got to have an eye for symmetrics and all that; and you're a frustrated pharmacist, because you deal with medicine. So you've got a pretty good cross-section. And a psychologist, because you are dealing with people. And I think psychology is real important in dentistry.

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah. And where did you get your training?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: I have my degree from the University of Missouri, in <Kansas City>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. And then did you just return back here?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Well I had service time. Frank and I are old army buddies.

SUSAN ROGERS: You are, huh?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: One thing and another we didn't know- we didn't see each other in the service, but I spent a little over three years in <Texas> in the dental corps; went one place or another. Frank, you tell them your experience from <Indiana>- In- what, <Panama> to Correigedor.

FRANK CONRARD: No, no.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: You went the other way?

FRANK CONRARD: I went, first went through Ft. Sam Houston, then up to <Wisconsin>, then to <New Jersey>, and over to <Ireland>, <Ireland>, <Wales>, <Wales> to <France>, <France> to <Belgium> and, ah-

SUSAN ROGERS: You saw a lot of country.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah. He's a real experienced man.

FRANK CONRARD: And, uh-

PETER J. LINDEMANN:

(great deal of talking in the background...inaudible)

FRANK CONRARD: Ah, twenty months overseas, twenty-one months over, overseas.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh, uh huh, and then you returned back to <Flagstaff>?

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah. I wouldn't live any place else.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. I think that all my questions have been covered. Can you think of anything else, like maybe any big snows? Do you want me to turn this off for a moment? Or, okay can you think of any big snowfalls? I know there were lots of them, but anything that sticks out in particular in your mind?

FRANK CONRARD: One in 1915, one in 1936, one in 1949 and another one in 1967.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: That's about it. Hot damn, that's it, yeah, the 36 and the 48 and the 68.

FRANK CONRARD: ‘67.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: ‘67, yeah, that's right. Those are the ones I remember, really. And our winters were a lot just like we're having now. You could usually scrape up a snowball if you got on the north side of a building some place. Or it's usually dirty and messy just like it is, and the people that talk about the environment around here. Well when Frank and I were growing up every morning until about ten o'clock, there would be a smoke cover of this whole basin that we are sitting in. Because everybody cooked with and heated with wood stoves, and you'd sit like, up here at the high school and look out and you’d see just about mid-way up on the observatory, would be a lid on this valley. And the wind dissipates it, and so our environment hasn't changed a good deal, but they tell you how impure it's getting, but ah-

FRANK CONRARD: Well, I don't think the wood smoke hurts you.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Oh No. I don't think, no not like your gasoline, ah-

FRANK CONRARD: Your coal.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: No I don't. And it dissipates pretty well, it's carbon and gets back in the trees, with our green trees around here, it cleans out pretty well.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: No Floods. In '36 after the snow of '36 the River de Flag went out of its banks. Wasn't that '36 when we had water clear up to the Campbell Hall, and the dining room up around the campus?

FRANK CONRARD: Let's see, was I here in '36?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: The spring of '36. Anyway there was about eighteen inches of water all over that area from- well the student union building and that ah- All that area was covered with about eighteen inches of water. River de Flag was ah, we sand banked it down there at Cherry St. to keep it from- It was out of its banks and coming through but it wasn't, didn't cut out. We sand bagged it.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: But we haven't really gotten a real run off since then that’s been that great.

FRANK CONRARD: That great?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: That was the way it worked out of <Oak Creek> and took out the bridge and the whole bit down there, and took a road out practically all the way through the canyon.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: The only- did you see Halley's Comet when it was here?

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: It was quite visible here, I guess.

FRANK CONRARD: Oh yeah.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: The only one I can, or not the only one, but one of them. We could deal of course, nationally, that could be seen with the naked eye, and it of course was right below the sun. You know, on our way to school, people were looking at it when I was still living on S. Agassiz. This was about 1924 or something like that.

FRANK CONRARD: Halley's was here in 1910.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah.

FRANK CONRARD: I think in 1910; supposed to be back in 1980.

SUSAN ROGERS: And you saw it in 1910?

FRANK CONRARD: You what?

SUSAN ROGERS: You saw it in 1910? And what was that like? Can you tell me?

FRANK CONRARD: Oh that's an awful long time ago.

(laugh)

PETER J. LINDEMANN: You weren't very old. You were ten years old.

FRANK CONRARD: I was six.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Six, yeah.

FRANK CONRARD: But I can remember it. We were going out, and we lived up there, and went out and looked at, and looked at it at night. It was a bunch of tails behind a star, the way it looked.

PETER J. LINDEMANN and SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: Frank, do you remember the flu epidemic in 1918?

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Can you tell me a little bit about how that affected <Flagstaff>? Were you in <Flagstaff> then?

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

FRANK CONRARD: Ah, well I mean it was just like any. Of course I wasn't very old then. The ah, well it would be just like any epidemic that, only worse. The worst it would be, because no one knew what it was or what to do with it. You had to wear . Well you had to wear gauze, or something over your face, so you could breathe through it. There was, oh people dying all over all over town. People that were sick. They didn't know what was wrong with them. They just had a heck of a time to trying to figure out what if was. Emerson School- they had that more or less as a hospital ward. Any building that they could use, well they had that as more or less a hospital. I don't remember too much about it.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now you don't remember any close neighbors being sick by it maybe, or was your family affected at all, or did they make it through?

FRANK CONRARD: Well, my brother was sick with it, but he got over it. He was one of the first ones to get it. He was going up to the- oh it was the Normal School then. But he was the only one who got it.

SUSAN ROGERS: I wonder how they buried all those bodies? Did they have to have mass graves? Or how'd they work it, do you remember?

FRANK CONRARD: I don't remember too much about that. Of course, I mean that was above and beyond me. I didn't pay any attention to it.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh, uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Frank's father was quite a machinist. He had the only machine shop in town. You could get, and he could make anything.

SUSAN ROGERS: Really?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah. I used to, when Dad needed anything, he'd always go down to Mr. Conrard or send me down with whatever had to be done.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now where was this?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Beg your pardon?

SUSAN ROGERS: Where was his business located?

FRANK CONRARD: Ah, well there's just a parking lot right across the street from the post office on the other side where . That was ah- then he moved over, oh across from- where is it, Milam Steam Laundry?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah, yeah the old Flag Laundry.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: In the old Pulliam house.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah. Pulliam's, where Tom lived down there. Well he didn't move over there, I mean, he died. John moved .

PETER J. LINDEMANN: John moved over there.

FRANK CONRARD: My brother moved over there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: John was on the volunteer fire department for years. Did you ever serve in the volunteer department?

FRANK CONRARD: No.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Neither did I, never. I was always too busy and I didn't join the National Guard either. I was-

FRANK CONRARD: Well I did.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: You- that's how you got in the service was through National Guard, was it?

FRANK CONRARD: No.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Or had you already-

FRANK CONRARD: No, they drafted me. And had five and one half years in the National Guard and somebody was telling me fifty years ago that I would make a lieutenant.

(laugh)

SUSAN ROGERS: Could you tell-

PETER J. LINDEMANN: You'd be full a colonel now if you'd kept it up.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Could you tell me a little bit about that volunteer fire department? What you remember, since your brother was on it?

FRANK CONRARD: Well, I can't remember too much about it. They had, well, let's see, Jack Wilson was the first one that I can remember. And oh, along in the early twenties, I think when they got the first fire truck. All the rest of them were just these carts, hose carts.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

FRANK CONRARD: And then they got American La France. Lou Keller was the driver. And let's see, there was Tom Tommy Long, Jack Wilson was the chief, Tommy Long and John, Pat Hogan.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Dickinson.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah, Carl Dickinson, Guy Sykes and ah-

SUSAN ROGERS: How did it work? I mean how did, if there was a fire-

FRANK CONRARD: Well they had-

SUSAN ROGERS: What did they do?

FRANK CONRARD: Well whoever that- only one man stayed at the fire hall, everybody else stayed at home. And when there was a fire, they had a whistle, and they'd call into this. It was the light company then, and they'd have steam boilers, and when they- that- they'd call in, and they'd tell them where the fire was. And they had signals, and they'd just blow the whistle a bunch of times. And then they'd start in and maybe blow it two times and that would mean a certain district, or three times or one. And each one meant a district. And that night all the fellas would get in their cars-

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Head to that district, yeah head to that district yeah, find out where the commotion is, that's about the way it was.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: You had to get out in the street and be ready to flag them down if you had a fire.

FRANK CONRARD: Yeah.

FRANK CONRARD: Well usually they'd tell them when they called in and say there was a fire. They'd tell them whose home it was.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah.

FRANK CONRARD: But then when they'd blow the whistle they couldn't do it too good.

PETER J. LINDEMANN: Yeah. Didn't have radio contacts like they do now.

FRANK CONRARD: No.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. I think you've answered most of my questions. Can you think of anything you want to add or any people that you want to add or anything?

PETER J. LINDEMANN: You've got Gregg there should be interviewed. Have you have you interviewed Gregg?

FRANK CONRARD: Jim Gregg?

SUSAN ROGERS: I have his name, I know we have his name down.

FRANK CONRARD: He lives in <Sedona>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. I have a <Sedona> list. He must be on that list.
