SUSAN ROGERS: This is an interview with Mr. and Mrs. Francis L. and Clarabelle Decker. Mr. Decker came to Flagstaff Normal School from <Phoenix> in 1917, and Mrs. Decker came from <Oatman> to go to high school at the college in 1915, or I guess the Normal School.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Yes _________ right.

SUSAN ROGERS: This interview is being conducted on January 21, 1976 at <Camp Verde>, which is their home. I guess your address isn't really 735 ________?

CLARABELLE DECKER: See there are no addresses.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

CLARABELLE DECKER: We get our mail in a box. In fact your letter's stamped "Tell your _________".

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, really? Okay. (both laugh). Fine. Okay. Well their home is located now in <Camp Verde>. The interviewer is Susan L. Rogers, representing the Flagstaff City-Coconino County Public Library. Okay, Mrs. Decker, we'll start with you. Do you want to tell where and when were you born, and a little bit about your early childhood?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Well I was born in <Bellevue Colorado>, November 3, 1900, and lived there until I was nine years old. And then my father worked at the Tom Reid(?) mine in <Oatman> and sent for my mother and all of us children; six of us. And that's how I happened to go to <Oatman>. We came from <Colorado>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Ah, we ah, I entered as a sophomore in high school in <Flagstaff>. And there were no sororities there, but there were what they called "societies". And one was the Adelphians and one was the Literati. And, ah, you know, of course there was great animosity between them. I belonged to the Adelphian. Ah, the, ah, we who were in the dormitories, see I was in Bury Hall, there were only three dormitories, girls' dormitories: Bury, Campbell, and Morton. And then there was the boys' dormitory which they call Taylor Hall now, but they didn't then; it was Boys' Dormitory. And, ah, we, we who lived on the campus, you know, ah had, you know, quite rigid rules. Ah, for instance we had to be in our rooms at seven at night. We weren't allowed out of the room without ah, the matron saying, we would report to her, "May I borrow a ruler from" and you know. And we weren't allowed to go to town dances. But we had dances all the time up on the campus. And they were all held in what is now Hanley Hall. But then it was the dining room.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Ah Dr. Blome was the principal. And we, the boys all had to wear shirts and ties. And we never sat down in the dining hall until Dr. Blome had sat. Then he said a prayer. And every Sunday we changed tables by drawing a slip at the door. And a senior was the head of the table. And we went to that table and stayed there a week. And that got us, you know, acquainted with the other people. Ah, Dr. Blome and Mrs. Blome, of course, sat at the head table. You had to be in bed, supposedly at ten. I mean the lights went off.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now did you have a roommate?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Ah, I had a room mate until I was a senior, and she was Marbrey(?) Henning, from Holbrook. Ah, of course, she's dead now. And, ah, I had another roommate, Viola Fairbanks. We were, our rooms were inspected every week, Friday. And Miss Barber(?), who was our matron, left us a note telling us what was wrong with our room, if something was wrong. And then every Friday night, evening we had what she called a house meeting. And she called us all together and told us things. You know, of course we were little. You know I was fifteen. And we needed to be told things. You know, we had no moms there. And as I think back, I think she did us a lot of good. She, I knew many of the things that she told us, but lots of the girls didn't. She told us things about manners and how to act and how to be a lady, you know that sort of thing, which was good for, it didn't hurt us.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you used to complain about it at the time, though, or?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Ah, I suppose, I think so, but ah, yeah, I think so. (both laugh). And she always delivered the mail. There were little pigeonhole boxes, but we didn't go and get our mail from the pigeonhole. We stood around, and she would call our name and hand out the mail to us. Ah, all, I think they did that in all the dorms, I'm not sure, I think they did.

SUSAN ROGERS: Well did you get mail every day? Was there mail call everyday?

CLARABELLE DECKER: We could, yes, yes, uh huh, and it was delivered. A boy, one of the boys from the boys' dorm. I suppose was paid. And I can recall his carrying a bag over his shoulder. And he dumped it at each dorm, you know. And then Miss Barber, see, is the one who stuck it in the various boxes, in our dorm. Of course I was in Bury Hall all the time until I graduated at summer school. I was in various halls because I kept going back to <Flagstaff>. Because, when I graduated, you see, I just graduated from the Normal, and I wanted a degree. And so I got a scholarship to the University of Arizona so I was gone one whole year. Then, the University of Arizona held their summer sessions at <Flagstaff>. Maybe because it was cooler or something. And so I was up there during those sessions, too. And the library was in Old Main. In fact everything was in Old Main. And it was on the top floor. And if you're standing in front of Old Main, it was at the last cupola, up, up high. And never dreaming that I would some day be a graduate librarian, I never went near it unless the teacher in English told us to go and pick out a classic. And she told us which classics to read. And then, course, we had to make reports, you know, in English. Miss Boyer, who has a book that we have, it's a big, fat book. It's called, something about <Arizona>. Anyway it's western. And later when I was older, I took <Arizona> literature and by that time I had a feeling for literature. And I didn't like that kind of literature. I remember how bored Zane Grey made me.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, really?

CLARABELLE DECKER: And of course we had to read Zane Grey because he was part of her, you know, bibliography. So instead of reading, see mama had all that junk, and I had read it at home. And so I chose a book which was interesting and was true, and it was called Roping Lions In The Grand Canyon, which was informational and very interesting to me.

Dr. Blome's office was in Old Main, but downstairs on the right, see the library was on the left; but he was down stairs. All the classes were in Old Main with the exception of, I took Home Ec at one time, and it was in that room that's right across from, well I don't know, as you go around the corner, it's now called the music hall, I think.

SUSAN ROGERS: Ashurst? The Ashurst Music Hall that was connected-

CLARABELLE DECKER: Yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: Later on it was connected to Old Main.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Yeah, and it had the first auditorium.

SUSAN ROGERS: Right, that's Ashurst there.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Yeah, uh huh. Well that's where I took home ec in that building. Otherwise every thing was in Old Main. The one thing I think was a mistake, they didn't counsel us quite right, because when I went to the University of Arizona I was deficient in a language. They didn't make me take a language, which they should have. You know, Spanish, French, they had it there. And so I remember that when I went to the University of Arizona they let me have two years for one, because I, you know, was there and could handle it I guess...not very well. We had an assembly everyday after third period. And I can remember that I took Chemistry, and I liked it very much. Mr. Adams taught it. And we would come up from Chemistry, see after third period, and we'd all cough. Cough, cough, cough, cough. You know, nothing to cough about but just to make a commotion, you know. And I can remember Mr. Adams stepping to the front of the podium and saying, "That is my Chemistry class, I'm sorry to say." (both laugh)

SUSAN ROGERS: Now where were these assemblies held?

CLARABELLE DECKER: In the ah, we had a new auditorium didn't we Luke? I know they had a podium, and they had a grand piano. It was a player piano. And we were entranced when it was bought, because it played things by itself, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: Right.

CLARABELLE DECKER: And we all sat in the assembly, it was in the assembly, because our seats were double seats. And we were alphabetically arranged. We were also alphabetically arranged in every class. And I can remember their playing "Humoresque" on the player, and all of us jumping, you know to make a commotion, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now what kind of things did they tell you at these assemblies everyday?

CLARABELLE DECKER: A teacher was in charge. Now like when Miss Caldwell, who taught Spanish, and of course I didn't take it. When it was her turn, she would have her class sing a song in Spanish. It was a Spanish program. When Mr. Honn, who was vice principal, gave an assembly, he would have his super-duper students with a black board do problems- kind of baffled us. It was, but it was a teacher, you know, in charge.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now how long was each teacher in charge, like a week at a time, you mean?

CLARABELLE DECKER: No.

SUSAN ROGERS: A day, or?

CLARABELLE DECKER: A day.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, a day, it was always rotating.

CLARABELLE DECKER: All the time.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now how long was that? An hour or-

CLARABELLE DECKER: Uh huh, about, or forty-five minutes, maybe, you know. It was just before noon so it was a class period, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

CLARABELLE DECKER: we had a debate team and it was taught by Mr. Lathrop(?), a very fine teacher. He taught geography, too, and I took it. And I was on the freshman debate team. And we debated the freshmen of the University of Arizona, and we beat them. (both laugh). And I remember the two people who were with me on the team were Mae Calhoun and Franklin Walker. Franklin Walker's father was my Civics teacher. And Franklin later became a Ph.D., and I guess his father did, too. I know Franklin was down at San Diego State as a teacher. And one of the "Pines" came out and said, "Mrs. Decker discovers lost alummi". They had put a little article in the "Pine" saying, "Nobody can find Franklin Walker." And so I went to Who's Who In America, and there he was. And it told where he had been a Rhodes Scholar and gave his address, and all about him. And of course I was in class with him. And we did things that kids do, you know. I remember I sat next to Franklin. He was, he was very bright. And he and I decided we would change papers. And I would pretend I was he and he was I. And so I put my name on his paper, and he put, although the pa... and of course the teacher, you know, got on to it right away. And she just wrote," how does this happen to be", you know, Franklin's paper and how did your, you know. (both laugh). There was a tennis court out in the middle, right in front of Old Main, right out. And the kids used to roller skate there. And we used to ice skate, too, on the mill pond. And we got our board and room for $18.00 a month; a good meal. And students were waiters or waitresses. And they were, also worked in the dining hall. And my senior year I was a waitress. And I, but all I had to wait on was the football table, (both laugh) because they were special, you know. They had had to have special food, and so I didn't really wait tables, I waited on them.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh, so it was not a cafeteria style.

CLARABELLE DECKER: No, oh no. And they were- it was like family. It was a dish, and you passed it around.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, so what you, what the waitresses had to do was bring it out from the kitchen and put it on the tables.

CLARABELLE DECKER: The waitresses, it was there when we got there, you know, and before Dr. Blome, you know, had us sit down.

SUSAN ROGERS: And there was no choice, you ate what they gave you.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Oh, definitely. And it was- and everybody griped. I mean not everybody, but it was good, wholesome food. You know we, it didn't hurt any of us. It was meat and potatoes and vegetables and, you know, a salad and dessert, and well cooked.

SUSAN ROGERS: And you always got enough? Could you have seconds and thirds?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Oh plenty, yeah. Oh yes, you could have seconds if you wanted. Uh huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, and they served you three meals a day?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: And it's not like it is now where you can go in between certain hours like from eight in the morning 'til ten. You just had to go.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Definite time. Breakfast was 7:30.

SUSAN ROGERS: And that was it.

CLARABELLE DECKER: You know, lunch was at noon, and dinner was, I forget, five or five thirty. And before they would open the doors, which were sliding doors, to let us know we could come in, we would- there was a piano in the lobby and one of my friends, Bunny Baxter, could play the piano very well. And she'd play and we'd dance out there, and (both laugh) we had a glee club. And Miss Rose Walsh, who became Mrs. Babbitt, one of the, was the teacher. I was in the glee club. And then we had, if we were going to go on and be teachers, you see, we were kind of, well there was no name for us. See we freshmen, sophomore, what were we, you know, so they called us "third years". So we were "third years". And I was president of the third year class. And I can remember our going to a class meeting and one of the big girls saying, "And a little child shall lead them." (both laugh) Because I was little. And we had a senior class play when I graduated. And I had the lead in it. And the play was "What Happened To Jones?" And it was directed by the other Miss Walsh. Miss- was it Rose or Margaret? It had to be one or the other. 'Cause one of them is still "Miss", and the other one, the Mrs. Babbitt, I think is dead. Um, but it was fun.

Our graduation was in 1919, and so that made me, you see, I had five years in, but I wasn't a graduate, so I wasn't a bachelor because they didn't give bachelors. And so our graduation program was held in the Orpheum Theatre. The same old Orpheum that's there. And the speaker was Dr. von KleinSmid, who was the President of the University of Arizona at that time. Then later he became Chancellor. He was Chancellor when I went there. And then he went to, I think, a University in <California>. And there's a dormitory at the University of Arizona called the Elizabeth B. von KleinSmid Hall. It's named after his wife. And, oh they, you know, they had a girl's basketball team which, you know, they don't have now.

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah, right.

CLARABELLE DECKER: And Mother Hanley, for whom Hanley Hall is named, was the head of the dining room. And she was the head of the cooks and the kids who waited tables and everything. And, I remember these swinging doors, as you carried a tray, you know you either give them a kick or you pushed it with your elbow, and they swung in and out, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: And there was a kitchen right there where the food was.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Oh, right in connection with, uh huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Now that is all I can think of the- oh, we used to walk down town, of course, anytime we wanted to. We always had to report in, always. You wrote your name, you told where you were going, and to Miss Barber, and then you reported in when you came back. But we walked down Beaver, and of course Beaver's still there. But everything were board walks, everything. There were no paved sidewalks anywhere around.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now when you walked down town was it pretty empty along that Beaver Street, or were there some houses?

CLARABELLE DECKER: There were houses.

SUSAN ROGERS: Just about like now on there?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Ah, one, there's one house I can remember them building while we, I was there. And that house is still there. It's a brick house. But, yes, there were houses, but not- And of course the stores were- Fines was not. That was Nackard's, and Mr. Nackard ran it, the father of the Nackards who are there now, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh, uh huh.

CLARABELLE DECKER: And we would go in, and we bought spools of thread or whatever we needed like that, you know. But there was never any trouble. I mean everybody liked everybody, and everybody knew everyone, because it was so small. But when Dr. Blome was let out because he was a German, we struck, and we didn't go to school. That was about as far as it went. There was no, you know, fisticuffs or-

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah, so how many days did you not go to classes?

CLARABELLE DECKER: I don't know. How many? Do you remember, Luke?

SUSAN ROGERS: Was it a week, a month, you know?

FRANCIS DECKER: (Francis Decker) A half a day.

SUSAN ROGERS: Half a day. (all laugh)

CLARABELLE DECKER: To show we were annoyed 'cause we- And I can remember Dr. Blome's coming in to the assembly and his voice quivered. And I can remember one thing he said. "This has always been the land of opportunity". And all, we all felt so sad. And then, of course, he was, after he left, Mr. Cornelius from, who was the principal down at Winslow, became President. But he wasn't "Doctor", he was "Mister". And he and his wife, and he had his own little boy, Jackie.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. Now how did this Dr. Blome thing come about? Did this all confide(?) one day and you found out, or was it rumored before hand?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Ah, it was done by the school board. Francis will know more about that. I remember Mr. Hennessey, I think, and Mr. McGonigle were on the school board. And so, but I don't remember knowing far ahead. Just all of a sudden we knew he wasn't going to be, he had to leave. And it was a very sad thing for us. And when Mr. Cornelius came, he was in, he was a lieutenant, wore his lieutenant uniform. And then, of course, the faculty practically all walked out.

SUSAN ROGERS: They did?

CLARABELLE DECKER: There were very few teachers that were left.

SUSAN ROGERS: This wasn't a popular move with anyone.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Oh no. They, there were a few that stayed. Miss Boyer stayed, but almost all teachers left.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, now when you had that strike for half a day, or however long, did you get in trouble with your dorm mother or anything?

CLARABELLE DECKER: No.

SUSAN ROGERS: You just sat in your room or what?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Because they all-

SUSAN ROGERS: They agreed.

CLARABELLE DECKER: They all left, too.

SUSAN ROGERS: So did you stay in your dorm room that day, or did you go sit somewhere, or what?

CLARABELLE DECKER: I think we wandered around, probably on the campus, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: But you weren't organized? It wasn't an organized protest?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Oh no, no. Except that everybody, maybe, it seems to me that everybody struck, but maybe one or two. It just seems to me that we just simply disappeared. We weren't there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. Okay, let me turn this over to the other side.

END TAPE 1, SIDE 1, BEGIN TAPE 1, SIDE 2

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

CLARABELLE DECKER: And that's how I knew Francis. Because in 1917, of course, I was still there as a student when he was a student. And he, you know we were friends. But I didn't go with him except occasionally, you know. I went with various people.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you have something more you want to tell me or do you-

CLARABELLE DECKER: No, I didn't marry Francis.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

CLARABELLE DECKER: I married four years before he did. And then I moved away. And of course I taught then. But I got my degree, by that time it was four years I had been coming up to summer school from wherever. We lived in <Winslow> then. And by that time I had my little girl, Donna, my only child. And I remember Mother Hanley trying to keep her quiet during the graduation, and finally came and said, "Clarabelle, I can't keep her quiet any longer." And I left to take her. And that was my- you know, and after that I taught.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, okay. Ah, let me go back and ask you a couple of questions, okay? First of all, I don't think I asked you what your maiden name was.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Douglas.

SUSAN ROGERS: Douglas, okay. Now you said, like when you had this room check, and they'd say that something was wrong, how often was there really something wrong? What kind of things were wrong?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Your bed isn't smoothly made; you- it is dusty on the radiator. See we had radiators.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Or your clothes closet could be better arranged. But always there was a note. Now if it was in good order, then you got, "your room looks very nice". We always got a note of some kind.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now how often did you have it?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Every week, every week, every Friday of the world.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh, okay. Now did you used to go home on weekends or did you stay?

CLARABELLE DECKER: No, I didn't because my mother then was in <Los Angeles>, and so I didn't, I went home with some friends. Girls that were lived close, like Marbrey lived in Holbrook and Bunny Baxter lived in <Wickenburg>. And so I often spent weekends away from school, but but not home, because I lived in <Los Angeles>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Right, okay. When you went home for these weekends did the girls' parents usually come and pick you up? Or did you-

CLARABELLE DECKER: We went on a train.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, you went the train. Do you want to tell me a little bit about the train?

CLARABELLE DECKER: You know, we went every place on the train. And ah, of course now, when I came from <Oatman> to <Kingman>, it was, a what they called a stage, and then I took the train to Flag. And I remember one time that I was away at Christmas and arrived, and there was a deep, deep snow bank. But Dr. Blome had arranged for an escort to meet us and to escort us the best way through the banks to get to the dorms.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh, okay.

CLARABELLE DECKER: But the trains, you know, they had a fellow who sold apples or candy or candy bars. He'd walk through the train, you know. And I even rode the train with Marbrey to go to Holbrook. We'd get off, we, I can remember going to dances in Holbrook. I remember Francis coming down to be my escort when I was in Holbrook. And, can you think of anything else that I?

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, now you said that when you were in the dorm that you had to stay in your rooms. Does this mean that you couldn't even go next door to visit the girls?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Oh you couldn't; absolutely.

SUSAN ROGERS: You couldn't do that?

CLARABELLE DECKER: No, absolutely not.

SUSAN ROGERS: So you said, like when you wanted to borrow a ruler, you said you had to go to the house mother, ask her and go back.

CLARABELLE DECKER: And then, definitely. You, and you, now, and really when I think of it, I don't think I broke those rules except the "lights out" rule, we used to break. We would light a candle maybe and stay up a little later.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now, were you doing homework or just reading?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Oh gabbing. (both laugh)

SUSAN ROGERS: So you had to become really good friends with your roommate then.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Oh yes, oh yes. And we were. I can't ever remember, as a matter of fact I can't remember having words with anybody; we all got along. Every time the, I have ever seen any of these people who are grown, it's, you know, a friendly greeting. I didn't ever have any trouble.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Now was there water in your room? Did you have a sink then or not?

CLARABELLE DECKER: We had a lavatory, you know, a bowl. But to take a bath you had to go down the hall. And so you had to see that nobody else was there, you know, and take your turn.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now did you have to ask permission, did you have to sign up or anything or?

CLARABELLE DECKER: No, no. And we would take the bath. The same, the mop buckets or any, you know, the dust cloths and things were also in a storage place. And we knew where it was, you know. And we were able to keep the rooms as clean as kids do, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: Back to this visiting, though. Did any of the girls break that rule of going into another room?

CLARABELLE DECKER: I guess. I imagine.

SUSAN ROGERS: That seems real strange to me.

CLARABELLE DECKER: I imagine they did, but I don't know. Miss Barber was extremely strict. And she was probably far more strict than Mrs. Hanchew(?), or, you know, the other, Mrs. Robinson. And so, I mean, you didn't want to get in trouble. I mean that was my idea.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now what happened if you did get in trouble, do you know?

CLARABELLE DECKER: I imagine she restricted. I think she did restrict some girls. And they would be restricted to the campus and couldn't go down town, maybe, for a day or two. But there was no problem, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

CLARABELLE DECKER: We had a laundry.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, that's the next question I was going to ask you.

CLARABELLE DECKER: We had a laundry, and it was down in the basement, and we had to do all our laundry down there; or sheets or whatever. And I got the measles while I was there. And Miss Barber got the doctor. It was she that- you know. And, it was three day measles. And I couldn't go out for three days.

SUSAN ROGERS: There was no infirmary, though.

CLARABELLE DECKER: No.

SUSAN ROGERS: You were just sick in your room?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Well, later on there was an infirmary, but not at first.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now would they bring meals to you then?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: From the dining room?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: What would happen if you missed a meal in the dining room?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Nothing.

SUSAN ROGERS: It didn't matter if you didn't come?

CLARABELLE DECKER: No.

SUSAN ROGERS: It was all right.

CLARABELLE DECKER: And lots of kids didn't like that seven-thirty early breakfast, and so they wouldn't get up. Now I don't know what happened. I usually got up.

SUSAN ROGERS: Well could you have food in your rooms?

CLARABELLE DECKER: We could, yes. Like if we'd say mama would send us a fruit cake, you know, we'd have that for snacks. And we'd dole it out to the kids that we liked best, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: Right, okay. Where did Dr. Blome (pronounces "Bloom") live? Did he live on campus?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Yes. It's "Blome".

SUSAN ROGERS: "Blome"

CLARABELLE DECKER: B l o m e.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

CLARABELLE DECKER: He was, he and his wife were the head of the Boys' Dorm. And so Francis lived here on part time, there, part time he lived down town. So of course he could go places down town. Oh we could go to plays. If there was play coming, you know, that was a good play, and we, they allowed us to go to those.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now were these down town you mean?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Uh huh, down town.

SUSAN ROGERS: Where would they be held?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Ah, usually, golly were they in the Orpheum, those plays?

FRANCIS DECKER: I don't know anything about them.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Well anyway, the boys, I know that I went to one, to a play and the boy that I went with ushered. And so I was by myself until he got through ushering. And then he came back and sat down.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

CLARABELLE DECKER: So the kids did the ushering.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, I was going to ask a little bit more about where did you usually go on dates? Where did the students gather?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Oh, we, we walked up the railroad tracks, and we had bob sleds, and we shot down Mars Hill, except they didn't call it "Mars "Hill then, they called it "Observatory Hill". And we rode on some boy's back, and he'd skid around, you know. And that was our fun, besides skating and you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: Was there any special soda shop or anything like that?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Oh yes. Oh we congregated at The Den. And The Den is where now the bakery is.

SUSAN ROGERS: Down town you mean?

CLARABELLE DECKER: In town.

SUSAN ROGERS: Near Bledsoe's you mean or...?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

CLARABELLE DECKER: But, it was called "The Den". And Mr. Borum(?), who owned it, fixed a room in back and had a piano in there, and we danced. And Bunny Baxter, this girl, would play. And we could go down there and dance, and we did all the time whenever we were down town.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now on weekends, if you had a date, could you stay out later?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Ah, eleven was the-

SUSAN ROGERS: Eleven on weekends?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Uh huh. And I can remember some girls who were on the lower floor leaving a little bit of their window open so they could raise it, you know, and go in. But I happened to live in a different area. (both laugh) But of course we all knew, you know, what was going on.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Ah, you said you were on the debate team. Can you remember some of the different topics?

CLARABELLE DECKER: The only topic I can remember was when we beat the University of Arizona freshman team, was "Should there be ownership of, government ownership of rail roads". (both laugh) That was it.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now can you tell me a little bit about the class rooms, maybe some of your outstanding teachers, maybe about their teaching methods, the discipline in the class room?

CLARABELLE DECKER: To me, in every class I was in there was perfect discipline. Miss Boyer taught me English. I didn't budget, and I sat next to a girl with a "D" because I was "Douglas", you know. We were always like that in every class. Mr. Lathrop was a very fine teacher. He taught Geography; he was outstanding. Miss Botts taught me Ancient History; Mr. Walker taught me Civics. We just didn't, there was no discipline. We just didn't have to be told to shush 'cause we didn't talk.

SUSAN ROGERS: Mmm mmm. Okay. And how many classes did you have a day about?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Golly, about five.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now would each run an hour long?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Forty-five minutes.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. So what time did you get out of school then about?

CLARABELLE DECKER: About three-thirty.

SUSAN ROGERS: And did your homework then using the afternoon?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Well, if the English teacher had told us to get a library book, we went to the library, and we might do a little work there, but ordinarily it was all done in our room. And it was all done usually in study hour, which was seven o'clock, and it was from seven to ten. And that was it. We got it then you know. And if we wanted to show something to some other student, we went and asked Miss Barber for permission.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. This just about answers all my questions there, if Mr. Decker wants to add something. John told me that you used to work in the boiler room or something. Can you tell me a little bit about that?

FRANCIS DECKER: Not very much. It was just a small power plant right behind the old, what is now the Taylor Hall. Of course it's been enlarged since then. I think there were three boilers there. It was, we had a generating plant, generated electricity and furnished steam for heat in all the buildings.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now would you say that quite a few of the students did work their way through school, or is this the reason you were working, or is this just extra money for you or what?

FRANCIS DECKER: It wasn't extra, you mean I got the board and room for it.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, you did? Okay. What about the flu epidemic of 1918? What do you remember about that?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Everybody had it. And he nearly died.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you want to tell me about that? I heard it started on campus. Now do you remember anything about that, if it did in <Flagstaff>, that it started on the campus?

CLARABELLE DECKER: They furnished nurses to us, and I know Francis, who was very, very ill, and we had only one death. Did that one girl die from it, or did we have any deaths at all? They took awfully good care of us. I remember their giving me an aspirin every three hours. (both laugh)

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, now did you stay in the dorms when you were sick again, and they just had some nurses come in?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Uh huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did they have classes on at that time? So how-?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Uh uh.

SUSAN ROGERS: So how long would you say there weren't any classes?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Can you remember?

FRANCIS DECKER: No.

CLARABELLE DECKER: I just don't remember. I know that until we were able to be up and about that we were there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. Do you remember its effect on the community at all?

FRANCIS DECKER: She's asking you a question.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Well then I don't remember, because being a dormitory student, I was taken care of, and a nurse came in. I mean they were real nurses; had caps, you know. They had sent for them some place. And they took very good care of us, I know.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Ah, let's see.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Francis, also when he left the dorm, he lived down town at Doctor Zinn's(?).

SUSAN ROGERS: Now where was that located?

FRANCIS DECKER: Never while I was going to school.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Didn't you?

SUSAN ROGERS: It was after?

CLARABELLE DECKER: And when you worked for Mr. Cress in the tailor shop, were you going to school then? 'Cause I can remember I never went to town I didn't go past Cress's shop to say "hello", you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now where was that located?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Gosh, where was it, where Longley's isn't it? Wasn't it about where Longley's Barber Shop is?

FRANCIS DECKER: No.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Well, where was it?

FRANCIS DECKER: It’s on San Francisco Street.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Oh.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, um-

CLARABELLE DECKER: The post office was different, of course, was in a different location. There was one bank, and it was in a different location.

FRANCIS DECKER: You better correct yourself, there were two banks.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Were there two banks?

FRANCIS DECKER: Eventually three.

CLARABELLE DECKER: But, where was the post office?

FRANCIS DECKER: On the corner of San Francisco and Aspen, that was when I first got there.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Francis had worked previously, I mean he was just a kid. But I remember he knew Spanish, I guess from being out, you know, with the workers on his father's ranch. And I remember he was very good in Spanish, and Miss Caldwell liked him. (both laugh)

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Do you remember any big fires when you were going to school? Maybe on the campus even?

CLARABELLE DECKER: I can't.

SUSAN ROGERS: Can't remember?

FRANCIS DECKER: I think she's asking about fires.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Yes.

FRANCIS DECKER: Is that what you're asking?

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah. Do you remember any?

FRANCIS DECKER: I can remember a false alarm.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Is that on campus, you mean?

FRANCIS DECKER: Yes ma'am.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. What happened?

FRANCIS DECKER: Well you better ask her, she's-

CLARABELLE DECKER: No, I can't remember.

FRANCIS DECKER: ________________

CLARABELLE DECKER: Well, I sure don't.

FRANCIS DECKER: A young man by the name of Claude Fielding(?) was driving the fire truck that night. And two boys, who were going to school, living in the dormitory, Shorty Thrift(?) and Bill Askins, had arranged with Claude Fielding that they were going to turn in a fire alarm. I was working at the powerhouse that night, and after closing the powerhouse, of course, I went to sleep. And I was asleep during the false alarm. But they crawled in the westerly window, which is unlocked, and turned the fire alarm in from the powerhouse.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, no.

FRANCIS DECKER: And so the call was traced to there, and I was questioned regarding it at great length. And I was sound asleep. They turned the alarm in at Bury Hall. And one girl broke her leg.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Oh, yeah.

FRANCIS DECKER: Getting downstairs.

CLARABELLE DECKER: I remember. (laughs)

FRANCIS DECKER: I think her name was Dorothy Edson.

SUSAN ROGERS: And then how did they finally find out who really had done it?

FRANCIS DECKER: Well, I don't know whether they ever did know. I knew.

SUSAN ROGERS: Well you did. (laughs)

FRANCIS DECKER: Of course they questioned me at great length, but I was sound asleep. I never did know that there was an alarm turned in.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. What about any floods? Remember any floods in the area?

FRANCIS DECKER: Not particularly. Although ah the first summer that I was there they installed cement sidewalks on South Beaver Street.

SUSAN ROGERS: Huh. So that's 1917, huh.

FRANCIS DECKER: Yes that would be in the fall of 1917. In the spring of 1918 quite a few of them washed out. That was the result of the mill pond back of the old Arizona Lumber and Timber Company, which is located now where the-

SUSAN ROGERS: The Holiday Inn?

FRANCIS DECKER: Holiday Inn is located.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

FRANCIS DECKER: The mill pond broke and let the water down through that area of town.

SUSAN ROGERS: That must have gone all through that south side quite a bit then, huh?

FRANCIS DECKER: It probably flooded some of those Mexican houses on the south side.

CLARABELLE DECKER: What is that building that's right across from the Holiday Inn now? It was Mercy Hosp, it was the hospital.

FRANCIS DECKER: No, it's the old AL and T office.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Now-

SUSAN ROGERS: And then next to that was the Mercy Hospital?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Oh, that's where I got my first pair of glasses.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh really?

CLARABELLE DECKER: After I had the measles, my eyes became weak. And they were made by Dr. Schermann, who was a doctor, not an ophthalmologist, you know. He was, nor even an optician, but my first pair of glasses was made by him.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Now did he have an office in that building in the hospital that you went to?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Uh huh. And I can remember walking down the boardwalk, and he had dilated my eyes, and I remember what a time I had walking with dilated eyes.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. What about any big blizzards? I know there's been lots of snow falls. Do you remember any that particularly affecting the campus?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Well that one, you know I told you that Dr. Blome sent-

SUSAN ROGERS: What year was that, probably 1916?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Must have been, because I was little.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember the Orpheum falling in?

CLARABELLE DECKER: The what, honey?

SUSAN ROGERS: The roof on the Orpheum Theater?

CLARABELLE DECKER: No.

SUSAN ROGERS: That happened in 1916.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Do you remember that?

FRANCIS DECKER: I wasn't there.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Oh no, no, I can't remember that. See they graduated high school graduates and then Normal School graduates. And so as you look at old "Pines", you, I don't know if you can tell who is a high school, and who is a normal. Now like Orrin Compton, you know the attorney?

SUSAN ROGERS: I know the Comptons, yeah.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Of course Orrin and his wife have moved down to <Sun City> now, but Orrin was a high school graduate. Well I, being a third year, had another year to go, you see, before I could graduate. And I was a normal graduate whether it says so or not, you see. We were Normal people. And really we could have taught. See I got a scholarship from- every county could send a student down to the courthouse, and I went from <Mohave County>. Nobody else went down, so I went down. So I was the one from, to go from. So I had a year at the University of Arizona, see, on a scholarship. And two of my teachers that had been up at Flag were down there. So naturally I took their courses. Mr. Thorpe(?), and I forget who else. But the rest of the teachers, I guess, just found other jobs. There was just an exodus when Dr. Blome-

SUSAN ROGERS: There was? People actually quit, the teachers, huh?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Very few stayed. Can you remember who stayed, Luke(?)

FRANCIS DECKER: Oh, I could get a directory and find out who stayed.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Well Miss Boyer stayed, didn't she?

SUSAN ROGERS: Now when you said, when you mentioned this before I thought you meant they just stayed in this assembly when everybody walked out, but you mean people quit and left.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Oh, absolutely.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, I didn't understand that.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Oh, the teachers quit.

FRANCIS DECKER: They may have been fired.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh. A little of both, huh.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Maybe, maybe, could be.

FRANCIS DECKER: I think you should correct yourself about Dr. Blome being fired because he was a German.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Well, he thought that was it, didn't he?

SUSAN ROGERS: Were there other causes that you remember _____?

FRANCIS DECKER: He was a republican and had supported Tom Campbell in the election. And Governor Hunt was elected. And he appointed these old coots, McGonigle and Hennessey (Mrs. Decker whispers something and Miss Rogers laughs) with the understanding that they would fire Dr. Blome, which they did.

SUSAN ROGERS: But people believed that it was because he was a German-

CLARABELLE DECKER: Oh yes, because the war was on, you know.

FRANCIS DECKER: Hennessey and McGonigle attempted to use that as a- but I don't think it took very well.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

END TAPE 1, SIDE 2, BEGIN TAPE 2, SIDE 1

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. You were going to school during World War I. Did this have any effect on the school, do you think, as far as maybe a loss of students or something like that?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Oh yes. They all joined.

SUSAN ROGERS: They did, huh. So did it feel to you like there were a lot more girls at the school?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Uh huh, uh huh. In fact practically every boy, you know, able, who, you know, who was capable of joining, joined.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. What about any big crimes you remember happening?

CLARABELLE DECKER: There was one, now, I won't know this. Francis may know this different. But somebody broke in, climbed up, and broke in or lifted a window of one of the girls. And she, now whether, she wasn't attacked 'cause she yelled so he fled. Now maybe- I really feel that it happened, because I can remember going in the bathroom, and she was in the stall next to me, and she wanted my foot on hers. She was nervous.

SUSAN ROGERS: Huh.

CLARABELLE DECKER: And she married Dr. Manning, one of the doctors there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh, uh huh. Do you think over all that the girl students felt safe on campus?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Oh yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: You don't know of any other big problems?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Ah, there were- no, I don't think- I never was afraid. Of course, you know, you were in the dorm and you weren't let out.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Were there very many Indians going to school at all, do you remember?

CLARABELLE DECKER: None in my classes.

SUSAN ROGERS: How about any other minorities. Were there quite a few Mexicans?

CLARABELLE DECKER: None.

SUSAN ROGERS: You don't remember any?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Wasn't there one, was there a colored boy or not?

FRANCIS DECKER: Reginald Horn. His father was one of the janitors there. And he went to school. I think through 1918.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

FRANCIS DECKER: There was a Chinese girl.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Oh, yes.

FRANCIS DECKER: Went to school and lived in the Boys' Dormitory.

CLARABELLE DECKER: She lived as, she was a, wasn't she a kind of an exchange student or a-? And she lived with the Blomes. They were her-

FRANCIS DECKER: It wasn't an exchange.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Well, they over saw her. Didn't they always watch over her?

FRANCIS DECKER: She was sent here by the Chinese government.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: So she was actually, she wasn't American-Chinese, she was Chinese.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Oh no, she was Chinese. She was a bright girl, Lydia Woo(?).

FRANCIS DECKER: She didn't live with the Blomes. She lived in a room in the Boys' Dormitory.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Yeah but, the Blomes always came to meals with Lydia, I remember.

SUSAN ROGERS: Apparently she knew English, right?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Oh yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now if she was a type of exchange student, did she ever give any special talks or anything like that or-?

CLARABELLE DECKER: I can't- I don't think. Did the boys resent her being there?

SUSAN ROGERS: That's what I was wondering. How come she was in the Boys' Dormitory?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Was because of Dr. and Mrs. Blome.

SUSAN ROGERS: It was, huh.

FRANCIS DECKER: I don't think they ever resented her being there. And I don't think there was ever any snide remarks ever made about her.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

FRANCIS DECKER: At least I never heard them. She was a rather dignified type of character. And she was treated that way.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh, uh huh. Okay. Now were there some Mexicans going to school?

CLARABELLE DECKER: I can't remember if there were or not.

FRANCIS DECKER: There were people there with Spanish names. Whether they were Mexicans or Spanish, I do not know.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

CLARABELLE DECKER: In assemblies, when they were giving the, you know, when the teachers were putting on a program each week or day, we sat in seats that were double seats. But you were alphabetical. I sat with a "D" girl, whether I knew her or not. I mean you just sat, that's the way it was done.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. Now were the desks in the classroom double, too, or not?

CLARABELLE DECKER: No.

SUSAN ROGERS: They were single.

CLARABELLE DECKER: No, they were regular, as far in my class, just regular. One deal where you wrote, you know, just like now.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Where would you say, what areas most of the students came from?

CLARABELLE DECKER: In the summer, a lot of them came from <Phoenix>, of course. There were no cars, practically; we walked. But when the kids came up from <Phoenix> for summer school, maybe there might be a car or two. Or- didn't Calcart(?) have a car? Stutz Bearcat.

SUSAN ROGERS: What's that?

FRANCIS DECKER: He never went to school when I did.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Oh. But there were few cars, isn't that right?

FRANCIS DECKER: I don't ever remember any student ever having a car.

CLARABELLE DECKER: No, I can't remember either. And I can remember Miss McAfee, when I was a junior, and I was taking English from her, being late to class 'cause she plowed up the road, you know, coming to school. Would be stomping her boots as she entered the class, you know. So she- the teachers walked, too. Now Mr. Walker had a car, because I can remember having a date with his son, Franklin, and Franklin and I took that car of Mr. Walker's. And I don't know where we went; picnic or something. We used to go on picnics.

SUSAN ROGERS: Like, now to what areas, <Walnut Canyon>?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Yeah, or we walked. Sometimes we even walked to the cemetery and looked at the head stones. Or you'd walk to Lake Mary, or you'd take- Now Mother Hanley would fix a lunch if we were really going on a safari. And like, some of us wanted to go to Mt. Elden. She'd make us a lunch, and we'd carry it. We'd have water, and we'd go as far as we could, you know. I remember going to Mt. Elden when there was still snow, 'cause we had to stop because we couldn't go any farther.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you used to go down to <Oak Creek> much?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Well you couldn't go to. I didn't go to <Oak Creek>, it doesn't seem to me, unless somebody with a car would take you, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: But there, was there any kind of class picnic down there at that time? I know there was later, I don't know if there was then.

CLARABELLE DECKER: I don't.

SUSAN ROGERS: You don't remember?

CLARABELLE DECKER: I didn't go on them.

SUSAN ROGERS: About how many teachers were there at that time?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Of course one of the old yearbooks would show it.

SUSAN ROGERS: Right, okay.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Geography, English, Spanish, Wood Work. They called it- was it "slide(?)". Reba Switzer took it. It was Wood Work, Wood, you know. And Home Ec; one semester of Cooking, one semester of Sewing. I took it, I remember. I was a sophomore, you know, a little kid. Too young to do either of them very well.

SUSAN ROGERS: What kind of a relationship was there between the students and the teachers? Did they spend a lot of extra time with you, maybe socially?

CLARABELLE DECKER: They would if you needed it, I'm sure, because they were very good. Like Mr. Lathrop was a very fine teacher, and Mr. Walker was. Mr. Young(?), he taught Civics. We had every subject that high school kids have, except we didn't have any frills like, there was no marriage, you know, family relations, or anything like that. We had just the regular courses, you know. But they were well taught. I feel that I got a very good high school back ground there. And it was high school definitely. And then when I went to the University of Arizona of course, I was at a University. And then's when I had to make up the French, you see, because I'd had no language. And it was college, and I really got a lot out of it, too. And then when I went to summer school, it was good. The courses I took were very good. I remember that Mr. Thorpe, who taught me English at <Flagstaff> and also at the University, because he had moved down there, made you have a feeling for good literature. I'm sure that's where I got my feeling for good things. Because, we had books at home, but we had Harold _________, and we had all of Zane Grey. And we had- my mother read to us good things, Robinson Cruso and, you know, but Mr. Thorpe(?) spurned anything out of, we'll say "Cosmopolitan", or any of those women's magazines, you know, it wasn't good literature he felt. And so I learned to know "Time" and whatever, you know, good things.

SUSAN ROGERS: Right, right. Were there quite a few local students that lived at home in <Flagstaff> and commuted?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Lots of them.

SUSAN ROGERS: There were, huh.

CLARABELLE DECKER: In fact, I think, weren't most of them or were they? The dorms were full, but a lot of the dorm children were grade school, too, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: In the dorms?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Yeah, and when we learned to be teachers, you know, and were taking methods of teaching. I took that from Dean Lintz, you've probably heard of her. We were trained on the training school children. They were our students. You didn't have to go to any other school, there were enough of them there. You know now they go into the schools and teach; we didn't.

SUSAN ROGERS: But now some of these grade school children actually lived in the dorm?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Oh, yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did they live in the dorms that you did or a different one?

CLARABELLE DECKER: They lived, well Marjorie Robinson, of course was the daughter of Mrs. Robinson, who was a matron, so naturally she was in Morton Hall. And then Ray McCoy was a grade school child, and he lived in the Boys' Dorm, and he was seventh or eighth grade. So some of them did and some didn't, I guess.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. Were they because they were from out of town?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Yes, yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: So how many would you say there were about, total?

FRANCIS DECKER: Relatively very few.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Yes, few.

SUSAN ROGERS: Very few, huh. Did the older kids kind of watch out for them, take care of them, or how did that work? Or did the dorm mother more or less do it, or something?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Now Ray McCoy was in the Boys' Dorm.

FRANCIS DECKER: That was before my time.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Was that before your time? I know that I taught in training school Guy Longley, now you know he has Longley's Barber Shop. He was a grade school student from town. I taught Mildred Dunn who married him. Of course now she's dead, and he's married again to Hutch's(?) wife, you know. But- and you know they didn’t ever give us any trouble. And there were, here I was about seventeen or eighteen, and I had no problems with those kids in seventh and eighth grade.

SUSAN ROGERS: And you were teaching them in the training school.

CLARABELLE DECKER: And I was teaching them. Yes, yeah I taught, I can remember upstairs, I had to go upstairs to teach Geography. And the critic teacher, my critic teacher was Mary Hanley. It was before she married Joe Rickel(?), and she would come up and sit in the back of the room, watch me teach, and then she'd leave me a note. And I can remember one note saying, "Attitude of students and teacher is very excellent". So see, there you had no problem. They, the kids liked us. And we liked them.

FRANCIS DECKER: You should tell her what the training school consisted of.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, tell me a little bit more about it.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Well, what do you mean?

FRANCIS DECKER: It was principally Mexicans, you know, people from the south side of town were the training school students.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Well, Bill Longley and-

FRANCIS DECKER: Well, Bill Longley, that's an exception. There were principally Mexicans.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now some were from like the mills, the children?

FRANCIS DECKER: There would be a few who were living over in the area.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Joe Scalla(?), was he Mexican?

FRANCIS DECKER: Italian.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Well I taught him, and I had no trouble, no problem.

FRANCIS DECKER: But then you remember in the hallways those kids were, there were better than ninety percent Mexican.

CLARABELLE DECKER: I can't recall.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now, how long did you do this training? Did you do it for a semester, the teacher training?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Year.

SUSAN ROGERS: A year.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Yeah, they even brought a register in and showed us how to make a register. And they, it was very practical, very good training. I can remember the first school I had was at Thatcher, and I can recall that I emulated Mary Hanley. I mean, I tried to do exactly as she taught, because I thought it was good. And I had a seventh grade in Thatcher and no, no problem.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, can you tell me a little bit more about Dean Lintz, what you remember?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Dean Lintz taught us teacher's training. She always had a book, and we had the same book, and there was a book on Geography and a book on English. How To Teach English; How To Teach Geography; How To Teach, and each of us had this bunch of books. And she, I don't know whether she was good or not, you know. I remember a bunch of us were out getting ready; they made us teach one full day, everything before we graduated. Not just the subject we were teaching, but everything, so we would have the feel of a class. And we were outside her office, and I can remember somebody saying something about "the brats", and her coming out of the door, you know, saying, you people don't deserve to be teachers if you think of the students as "brats", you know. She was dignified. I don't think she was nearly as good a teacher as some I had, even though when she would be absent she would let me teach the class. (laughs)

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Ah-

CLARABELLE DECKER: She was very nice, very dignified and nice. They all dressed well. They, I think they were good examples to us, at least I felt the women were. And the men were very good teachers, I thought. And I thought Mr. Walker taught me civics very well. I think Mr. Lathrop was a very fine teacher. I can remember his getting down on the floor and drawing on the floor the currents to show us how the winds affected the, you know, the currents.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. How many men teachers were there compared to women? It seemed lot more men, lot more women.

CLARABELLE DECKER: What were there, about half and half?

SUSAN ROGERS: Make that half and half?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Seems to me there were. I believe there were probably more men than women, I don't know. I know Spanish was taught by a woman. And the teaching subjects like, you know, Miss Lintz taught (honey, put a piece of wood on, it's getting cold, I will), Miss Lintz taught that, and Miss Botts taught ancient History, so, see those are all "Miss". Miss Boyer taught English.

SUSAN ROGERS: So, you think most of the women teachers were "Miss"; they weren't married?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Mr. Adams was single. He taught Chemistry, and he married while we were there. He married the Home Ec teacher. I remember that. She was single. I didn't, you know, I didn't know they even had a crush, you know. Kids are dumb. (both laugh)

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. I probably should have asked this question way in the beginning, but can you tell me exactly what the difference was between the high school and the normal school? You keep saying about one graduating from high school and one graduating from normal school.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Well the normal school people took teacher training.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now this is even though they are high school age?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: See, I was thinking that they were old.

CLARABELLE DECKER: No, you see, now a person like Francis wouldn't take "methods of teaching" see, because he was taking the high school course. And then, of course, he went to college down in <Los Angeles>, 'cause he was business, you see. Now my typing teacher was a woman.

SUSAN ROGERS: So how did you decide if you wanted to go on to high school, or if you wanted to go-?

CLARABELLE DECKER: I had a feeling for being a teacher. I wanted to be a teacher, even when I was a little girl.

SUSAN ROGERS: So you could teach when you were eighteen?

CLARABELLE DECKER: You could teach, because you had, you were a normal graduate, but, and I think a lot of them took an examination and taught when they were a lot younger than that.

SUSAN ROGERS: But you had to keep going back to get more training 'cause you said ________.

CLARABELLE DECKER: I wanted a degree.

SUSAN ROGERS: You wanted more.

CLARABELLE DECKER: That's the only reason, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: But even if you had gone out just to teach would you still have to return in the summers?

CLARABELLE DECKER: I think it would be a decision that your school board would have made. Because now I worked for years, twenty, in <Las Vegas>, you know. And every five years we had to go to school. And we had to take four graduate units or five undergraduate, you know. We had to. But our diplomas that were given us when we graduated, we could have taught under them without any other training at all, couldn't we, Luke?

FRANCIS DECKER: Could right today. Had a life time certificate in <Arizona>.

CLARABELLE DECKER: And then when I went to <California>, I taught in <California>, they, of course they made you take <California> law, you know. 'Course we took school law, we had to take school law, you see, which the high school graduate wouldn't have to take, you see.

SUSAN ROGERS: But you were the same age. That's what I wasn't understanding.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Oh yes, oh yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: I have down here that you returned as a librarian in the 1950s?

CLARABELLE DECKER: I left <Las Vegas>. I was librarian in Las Vegas High School. And I married Francis in 1950 so that's why I quit and went to <Flagstaff>. And I, in the fall of 1953, Dr. Eastburn, who had been a math teacher up at the old normal, but I hadn't taken it, but I knew him, was the head of the college. I went up to him and asked him if he had any openings, and he said, "Yes, you can be an assistant librarian to Miss Ragsdale." You see, she was the only librarian. They had only one. And now that was in fifty-three, the fall. And so I was her assistant. And then they called me on the telephone and said they were setting up a new high school, they had only one high school in <Vegas>. And they were setting up a new one. And the man who was going to be the principal I had known at Vegas High. He wanted me to set it up. So Francis agreed that I could go over and set it up. And the building wasn't even built, so I worked in a storeroom. And all of the teachers that were going to teach down at "Rancho", which they called this new school. We all worked in this little storeroom, but they taught. But I was ordering books, ordering materials, ordering magazines, ordering the, telling them about the tables they needed, and you know, that sort of thing. So that when Rancho was ready and built was in April. And it was all there. And so then a truck came, and we loaded all the books. I went down with the truck driver. And he took the books and put them on a table, and I put them on the shelves, so it was all ready. So then they wanted me to be their first librarian, so Francis and I got an apartment in <Vegas>. And I was there six years, setting up my friends' little libraries in the grade schools. So the word got around, "Oh she has a library(?)" and,"Will you set up mine", you know. And so at the end of 1960, well when did I go back? '56.

FRANCIS DECKER: I don't know, but you should qualify the apartment. We didn't have an apartment there until the last year you were there.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Right. I lived with the principal, Helen Smith. And I commuted every two weeks.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh gosh! That's a long drive.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Uh huh, and-

END TAPE 2, SIDE 1, BEGIN TAPE 2, SIDE 2

CLARABELLE DECKER: I had the person who was going to be the librarian come down to Rancho, down to my work room and help do the work so she would know what the score was, you know. In other words, see they had no training. And so then I wrote a little booklet. Dr. Gray wanted me to do something for the junior, any junior high person who, see I set up I think six junior highs, and I think about thirty elementary. And then, of course, Boulder City High and their elementary, it was together, junior high and high were together. And we, I had a good staff; they let me have anything I wanted. They're awfully good. They, I mean they believed in me and what I asked for they let me have. If I needed a new typewriter, I got it. If I needed another girl, they knew I needed her. So I finally had four. And all the time we were pulling in books, see, from other schools. But we were doing Rancho's work and doing this other work. Well finally Dr. Gray(?) asked, "Will you be the supervisor and move up to the administration building?" Well that meant somebody had to take my place. And he said, "You choose the person that you think is best qualified." Well in the mean time I had a girl from one of the elementary schools that had to go to school during the summers. And so I kept at her to take library. So she finally got a degree from <Denver> in it. So, see, she was fully qualified, and so she was, I chose her. So she became the librarian at Rancho. And then she, eventually, became the state librarian. And then Herb Eckard(?), who is still over there in one of the high schools, became- took her place.

SUSAN ROGERS: Can you tell me a little bit about Mrs. Ragsdale?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Miss Ragsdale?

SUSAN ROGERS: Right.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Well, she worked like a dog. She wanted to do everything herself. She didn't want to give anybody any responsibility. And so she worked day and night. And so it got to the point where, see I had to work some nights from seven 'til ten, but she'd be in the back room, you know. She didn't have to be there, because I knew how to do it as well as she did. She worked awfully hard. And she did all the cataloging. And I would, when I was on duty, I had the desk, reference, you know. And she, gad, she wouldn't let you sit a minute. There'd be something I'd want to go back in the stacks and take a look at so I might give it to some prof, you know. And there'd be a journal, and so I'd have to take it home. You know she, you couldn't, if you were one minute not, I mean breathing, she brought you- or a stack of cards to alphabetize. She worked awfully hard.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. I think you've about answered all my questions. Mr. Decker, is there anything else you want to say, or Mrs. Decker?

CLARABELLE DECKER: I think Luke will tell me that I talked too much and said too much, and that I didn't give him a chance to say anything.

SUSAN ROGERS: I hope he was listening to you carefully, because he corrected you a couple of times.

FRANCIS DECKER: Well I thought you were coming down to get historical matters. I don't have anything to add at all.

SUSAN ROGERS: Well what do you mean by "historical matters"? Is there something?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Where the first flag was. Where was the first flag put up that made- they called <Flagstaff>? Isn't that historical?

FRANCIS DECKER: I think it's controversial.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Is it?

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah.

CLARABELLE DECKER: But I think that's the sort of thing he thought you were going-

FRANCIS DECKER: Well, there was a book written in 1912 it's out at the museum that had a picture that is purportedly the first flag staff.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Oh.

FRANCIS DECKER: Written by old Father(?) David(?). They didn't even know who the author of the book was, or the year it was published, until I had another book that was able to prove it to Mrs. Barton(?)

(This paragraph was very difficult to hear; very faint--ncw)

SUSAN ROGERS: Now where did that book say that the first flag staff was?

FRANCIS DECKER: It doesn't say; there's a picture which would indicate that it's near the Old Town Spring.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh, uh huh. Okay.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Were there any other, those trees, aren't they poplars that are on the campus?

SUSAN ROGERS: I don't even know.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Well they weren't there. That was-

SUSAN ROGERS: You mean up on the north campus?

CLARABELLE DECKER: Yeah, by, up from Taylor Hall. They weren't there at all. And I remember when Dr. Lowell, when they had the services for Dr. Lowell. I remember all of us kids let out to go down to the Orpheum where they held the memorial.

SUSAN ROGERS: Mr. Decker, is there anything else that you can think that-?

FRANCIS DECKER: I don't have anything.

SUSAN ROGERS: I ought to know, or anybody ought to know about?

FRANCIS DECKER: I don't think so.

CLARABELLE DECKER: I think those old annuals, you know, that are up in-

SUSAN ROGERS: Special Collections, yeah.

CLARABELLE DECKER: They have. See the first annual was the combination of the "Pine". It was 1916, I think, and it has Orin Compton's picture in it as a graduate, I know. And then, now mine will be in 1919, you see, because that's when I graduated there. And there'll be a lot of people that you'll probably know if you looked in those.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. I'll have to do that.

CLARABELLE DECKER: Old annuals, because I think they have them all.

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah, I think they have-

CLARABELLE DECKER: I'll show you, or give you, if you like, this booklet that Dr. Gray wanted me to write for the junior high librarians. And then also the personnel man at <Vegas> insisted that they go and get what they called "stamp"(?), you know, it isn't a degree, but it's enough hours that they can get the "stamp". It's still in existence, you know. And he simply told them if they didn't get it, they could give up their job. They had to have it. But this little booklet that I wrote was to help these people. And every Tuesday I used to ask them to come down to Rancho and ask me questions. And they would, you know. And things that were happening, and they wonder what to do about, and I'd tell them.

SUSAN ROGERS: Well, that sounds good. I'm going to turn this off now.
