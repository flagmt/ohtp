SUSAN ROGERS: Mrs. Espinosa, when and where were you born?

LOLA ESPINOSA: I was born in <Jemez Springs New Mexico>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. And can you tell just a little bit about your parents and a little bit about your childhood?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Well, I was brought to <Arizona> at the age of eight and raised in <Arizona>, married in <Arizona> had all of my kids in <Arizona>, and I’m still here. (Both laugh).

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Now was this in <Flagstaff>, or what parts of <Arizona>?

LOLA ESPINOSA: No, my four children were born in <McNary>, <Arizona>, and they were raised in <Flagstaff>. They went to school; went through high school in <Flagstaff>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. So when you first moved to <Arizona>, you went to <McNary>.

LOLA ESPINOSA: Yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: And, you were with your parents.

LOLA ESPINOSA: Uh huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Why did they move here?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Well, they didn't actually move over here. We moved from <McNary> to <Lakeside Arizona>; lived in <Lakeside> five years. And then, I was married in <Lakeside>. Well, actually that's where I was proposed to. But I married in <Holbrook Arizona> in Our Lady of Guadalupe Church there. And, then I moved back to <McNary>. And all of my children were born there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. What was <McNary> like then?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Well, it was a wood camp, mill camp; lumber camp rather.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. And is that what your husband, or-?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Yes, he was a, uh huh. He was a lumber mill lumberjack, or whatever.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about that? I haven’t talked to anybody who knew a lumberjack. Can you tell me what he did? (Both laugh).

LOLA ESPINOSA: Well, mostly all of his- from the age of sixteen, he worked at the lumber mill. He was either at the sawmill or the planing mill, or the lathing mill _______ ______. It had a- all it had to do was with lumber.

SUSAN ROGERS: And ah, was he born in <Arizona>?

LOLA ESPINOSA: He was born here in <Flagstaff>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. And what's his first name?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Ernest.

SUSAN ROGERS: Ernest. Okay. And what's your maiden name? I didn’t-

LOLA ESPINOSA: Lola Maestas.

SUSAN ROGERS: Maestas. Okay. And, so did you go to school in <McNary>?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Yes, I went to school until the sixth grade, and then I went to Lakeside to school. And I went to school until the eighth grade.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. And, tell me about those schools. You know, how big were they, who were your friends?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Well, as you know I don't have no trouble having friends.

SUSAN ROGERS: Right. (Both laugh).

LOLA ESPINOSA: So, the school in <McNary>, well that was ah, all together elementary and high school. So, it wasn't too big of a school. And Lakeside was the same. We had elementary and high school in the same building.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. All in the same building?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Uh huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: But you had a different classroom for each grade?

LOLA ESPINOSA: No we didn't.

SUSAN ROGERS: It was all in one room.

LOLA ESPINOSA: All in, uh huh, one room deal.

SUSAN ROGERS: Tell me about that; what was that like?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Well, it was a lot of fun, because you knew what you were going in the morning for, such as arithmetic and spelling, and maybe history. And then after lunch, you had to go for the other subjects.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh, uh huh. Did you eat lunch there or go home?

LOLA ESPINOSA: No, we had to go home.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember any particular big snows when you lived there?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Oh, we had many (?); we had a- many (?). We had four and eight feet of snow every, just about every year. But it was a whole lot of fun going to school in the snow. At least we felt so, anyhow. The idea of getting wet. (Both laugh).

SUSAN ROGERS: What games did you used to play in the snow? Any special games?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Oh, throwing each other on snow piles, and throwing snowballs.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh, uh huh. What kind of social life was there in <McNary>? Did they hold dances or anything?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Well, they had dances for the Mexican people. See they were kind of _______ _______ from getting together. And the Mexican had their Mexican dances in the Mexican part of town. See we were kind of segregated to begin with. Because the whites stayed on the top part of the hill, and the Mexicans and the colored stayed on the lower part of the hill, but different areas. And the Indians had their little "Indian town" way back behind the mill.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. So each group had separate social-

LOLA ESPINOSA: Separate, uh huh. For which the main event was dances.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. Let me see. Oh, but the school, all the people went together?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Uh huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: So, how did the children get over-?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Well, the white and the Mexican went together. And the colored, they had their own school to themselves, which was their church.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did this ever cause any problems?

LOLA ESPINOSA: No it didn't; no it didn't.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. What about your own childhood? Did you have special chores you had to do at home, or anything like that?

LOLA ESPINOSA: I had to carry water, clean the dishes, clean in the kitchen before I went to school. And then at noon, we had to come home and eat lunch and then wash dishes and clean the kitchen before we went back to school.

SUSAN ROGERS: And, did you have water in the houses?

LOLA ESPINOSA: No, we didn't.

SUSAN ROGERS: So, how did you get your water?

LOLA ESPINOSA: We had to go to the water hydrants up from the house.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, okay.

LOLA ESPINOSA: As a group, as a matter of fact there was a block to each pump in there, or hydrant, or whatever.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. And this was supplied by the lumber mill?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Uh huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. Were your houses built by the lumber mill?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Yes they were. Uh huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

LOLA ESPINOSA: And our bathrooms were outdoors. We had those outdoor houses which we had to keep clean; you'd keep them disinfected as much as possible.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh, uh huh. Okay. You got married in <Holbrook>? Was that what you said?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Uh huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. And then you moved to <Flagstaff>?

LOLA ESPINOSA: And then I moved back to <McNary> and had all of my children there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, okay. Tell me about- was there a hospital there?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Yes there was a hospital, but the Mexican people didn't get to go to the hospital. We had to have our children at home. With the doctor, he did come, and the nurse, but we had to have our children at home. Unless it was a real emergency case, they'd take them to the hospital.

SUSAN ROGERS: So, you say that the hospital was mainly for the whites.

LOLA ESPINOSA: Well, more or less.

SUSAN ROGERS: For emergency.

LOLA ESPINOSA: In emergencies.

SUSAN ROGERS: But the doctors would come.

LOLA ESPINOSA: Yes, they would come. All of my children were born with a doctor and nurse.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. What about shopping. Where did you shop in <McNary>?

LOLA ESPINOSA: We had to shop at the McNary Mercantile Store.

SUSAN ROGERS: Is that the same one that is still there?

LOLA ESPINOSA: I believe so. We had the drug store and the hardware department, everything in the same building, too.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh, uh huh. There used to be a hotel there?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Yes, the Apache Hotel.

SUSAN ROGERS: What was that like?

LOLA ESPINOSA: That was where- exactly- the colored, oh, the white people-

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, uh huh.

LOLA ESPINOSA: And you know, visitors of some kind that would go to visit the mill, or something like that.

SUSAN ROGERS: Was <McNary> between any two places so that there were a lot of tourists coming through, or not so much?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Well, they would come in the summer.

SUSAN ROGERS: So even then, it was starting to develop into a summer tourist trade. Did people from <Phoenix> have cabins up there then?

LOLA ESPINOSA: No they didn't. They stayed at the hotel, or some of them would bring their trailers-

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. So, let's see, and you lived in <McNary>, how many years then?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Well I lived in <McNary> from 1925 to 1932, and then I lived five years in Lakeside, and then moved back to <McNary>.

SUSAN ROGERS: How did you like Lakeside compared to <McNary>?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Well, it was wonderful, even though we were the only Mexican people living there at the time.

SUSAN ROGERS: But everyone was very nice.

LOLA ESPINOSA: Everyone was very nice to us. They were wonderful.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. And then you moved back to <McNary>.

LOLA ESPINOSA: We moved back to <McNary> and had my children and stayed there fifteen years more. And then in 1945, they had a big strike for money or what ever, the workers did. And we moved to <Flagstaff> then.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Your husband got a job, where?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Yes. Saginaw Lumber Mill.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, okay. And can you tell me anything about his job there? What did he do?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Well he was a rip saw man.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Describe <Flagstaff> for me, like when you first arrived, or even when you were young. Did you come to Flag?

LOLA ESPINOSA: No, I didn't come as young girl.

SUSAN ROGERS: No? At all, not to visit or anything?

LOLA ESPINOSA: No. Uh uh.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. So the first time you saw <Flagstaff> was what year then?

LOLA ESPINOSA: 1945.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. And tell me what you thought. What it was like. Describe it.

LOLA ESPINOSA: Well, it wasn't as big as it is now. See, all these new motels and hotels and service stations that come up. Holiday Inn (ED: Days Inn currently) is where the Saginaw Lumber Mill was. And, ah, it was just a little small town.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. And where did you live when you moved here?

LOLA ESPINOSA: I moved here, and I lived at East Phoenix Avenue.

SUSAN ROGERS: East Phoenix. Okay. And what kind of neighborhood was that, was it growing then, or was it already built?

LOLA ESPINOSA: It was already built, yeah. Uh huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: So, okay. And ah, what part of- do you still live in the same area you used to live in?

LOLA ESPINOSA: No, I moved. We bought a place in 1947 on South O'Leary Street.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you still live there?

LOLA ESPINOSA: I'm still there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Tell me about that side of town, or how was it developed. Was it developed then?

LOLA ESPINOSA: No, it wasn't developed then, not even part, Brannen Homes and Pine Knolls weren't there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Huh! Okay. And so when did they start building?

LOLA ESPINOSA: I think it was 1948 ______ ______.

SUSAN ROGERS: So, right after you moved down there, they started building quite a bit.

LOLA ESPINOSA: Uh huh. Yes. And it has really developed since I moved there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah. Where did you used to do most of your shopping?

LOLA ESPINOSA: At Food Town Supermarket.

SUSAN ROGERS: And was it called "Food Town" then?

LOLA ESPINOSA: No. It was "Hutchinson's Store" then.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. And, what kind of social things were going on then? _____ _____?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Oh, nothing that I knew anything about.

SUSAN ROGERS: Any special dances or-?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Not to my knowledge, hon. Of course I haven't been a dancer, never.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh.

LOLA ESPINOSA: No. That was something against my will. I don't know why I didn't like dancing, but I didn't.

SUSAN ROGERS: And did you go to the movies, too, or anything?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Well we went to the movies; we went to the restaurants to take the children to, eat out on Saturday and Sunday. And took them to the show. And then we went back home and relaxed (?). But we were always together.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Let's see. At that time, were there any special Mexican organizations in town?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Not to my knowing, hon.

SUSAN ROGERS: So you just pretty much stuck with your family at that time. You had a close family.

LOLA ESPINOSA: Uh huh. Yes, I had a close family, and I had thought of staying home with my children while they were little, and see about them; see about my house; clean the house and cook for them.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. Okay. When you arrived in the 1940s, do you remember the Fourth of July and the Pow Wow? Did you go to them?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Well, I went to- yes, I did. As a matter of fact, we all did; the whole family did. And they were pretty good; they were real nice.

SUSAN ROGERS: They were? What did they have?

LOLA ESPINOSA: They had the rodeos and the Ferris wheel and all the rides for the little ones.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. Do you remember any particular problems with the Indians?

LOLA ESPINOSA: No. We didn't have no problems with- no we didn't.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Do you remember, were there many Indians living in town at that time?

LOLA ESPINOSA: No. No, uh uh.

SUSAN ROGERS: They just came in-

LOLA ESPINOSA: They just came in for the Pow Wow.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. Okay. Since the 1940s, do you remember any particularly big floods or disasters or fires, anything like that?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Well, we had a big fire after, a little after we moved to <Flagstaff>. I think we lived there three years, or two years. And then we moved down Agassiz Street, we had a real bad fire there. As a matter of fact, the whole block burned down.

SUSAN ROGERS: What year was this about?

LOLA ESPINOSA: 1947.

SUSAN ROGERS: The whole block?

LOLA ESPINOSA: The whole block burned down.

SUSAN ROGERS: Huh. And do you know how it was caused?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Well, they claimed it was children playing with matches.

SUSAN ROGERS: Hmmm. What kind of fire department did they have then?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Well, they had a pretty good fire- you know, because they really had enough water then.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Do you remember any special artists around then? Were there any special painters or musicians or even famous people that came through town?

LOLA ESPINOSA: No, not to my knowing any. No.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. When do you think that the Indian jewelry became popular, or more tourism?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Well, I think more tourists since 1960, uh huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: So fairly recent.

LOLA ESPINOSA: Uh huh. Yeah recent, uh huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. I think that just about covers quite a bit.

LOLA ESPINOSA: Uh huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: Let me just ask you a little bit more about the lumbering. Did you feel that the wages that they paid your husband, like in <McNary>, were fair?

LOLA ESPINOSA: No, they weren't!

SUSAN ROGERS: They weren't. Can you tell me a little bit about it?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Now, they used to get twenty-five cents an hour. I guess different jobs have different wages, but they wouldn't go no higher than that. 'Cause I can remember him getting a hundred dollar check there. As a matter of fact, I have saved an envelope. They used to get paid in little envelopes. And I had saved a one with a ten-cent check.

SUSAN ROGERS: Ten-cent check.

LOLA ESPINOSA: Uh huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: My goodness.

LOLA ESPINOSA: But see, we had the chance of drawing what they called "coupons" between times, you know, to get a little groceries at the store.

SUSAN ROGERS: What do you mean, "draw coupons"? What did you actually have to do?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Well, we could go to the main office where they got paid, and we could go up there and just show his number. He had a little slip that he had to show, you know. And tell the secretary, you know, whoever that he wanted so much money; a two dollar book so he could buy groceries. We'd spend that at the store.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. And then would they take that money out of his next check?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Yes, uh huh. They would deduct that from his check.

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah, I see. Other than not paying you enough, do you feel that the lumber company took fairly good care of its people, like (?) benefits.

LOLA ESPINOSA: Well in a sense, yes. Yes, because they had their hospital ______ and sickness of any kind you could go to the- they could, anyhow. And, I think the wives could go, but only in real bad situations, if it was real bad, real bad sickness, they could go the-

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember any particularly special accidents that happened or, did you feel that a lot of accidents happened at the lumber mill?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Well in 1932, there was a train accident that was bringing in the logs from the woods, and the train exploded, and it killed a right smart man there. And then we had some accidents at the mill where a man got run over by the- oh, some kind of machinery. And I think some of them got their hands cut, their feet cut off or something like that. But they did get paid real good for it.

SUSAN ROGERS: For that.

LOLA ESPINOSA: Uh huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. How big a town was <McNary> then? Has it grown at all?

LOLA ESPINOSA: No, it has completely died, I think. There's not too many living there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah. So you think it used to be bigger.

LOLA ESPINOSA: It used to be, and it used to be a real liver. It was all, just like all in the past.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, uh huh. So were there lots of big parties? Did the lumber mill ever put on special parties or anything?

LOLA ESPINOSA: No, they didn't. Not to my knowing. Uh uh.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Can you think of anything else?

LOLA ESPINOSA: Well as a lumberman, he worked, here in <Flagstaff>. Saginaw was first, and then he went to Associate Lumber, which was right here by the gas station, here on Santa Fe. I don't remember exactly what the name of the station is. And then he went to work for Southwestfor awhile. And then he worked for Kaibab, where he was working when he passed away.

SUSAN ROGERS: I think you've just about covered my outline. Can you think of anything that I might have forgotten, or that you want to add about <Flagstaff> or anything, or-?

LOLA ESPINOSA: We were real lovable couple, thank God for that. He left real beautiful memories because we were always together. And we lived thirty-seven years and a month to the date, to the exact hour we were married. And he was a wonderful, wonderful husband. And that's the reason I couldn't marry nobody else, no indeed, uh huh.
