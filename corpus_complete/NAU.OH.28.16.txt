E. C. FLOREZ: I was a trucker, mail man, trucker and everything, same way here in <Flagstaff>. If I didn't have twenty jobs I didn't have any to take care of, so you can figure it out.

There was hardly anything since I seen this town grow check by check and the college too. Till 1918 I play for dances all my life. When I start playing music I play the trumpet, but I had to read the music in order to play it. The professional won't let you play music without a readin' it.

I had nine passenger trains each way, and besides the President of the <United States> and movie stars, I have to unload and take care of ‘em. ____________________ I ___________ home watchin' news on the television. When they get through, well I told ‘em get out and walk talk to people, go out and get so . I go down through town. I sit down nearby and talk to- I know everybody, talk to ‘em, make ‘em laugh and smile, give ‘em a candy I carry in my pocket. Make ‘em happy look here.

E. C. FLOREZ: The Santa Fe depot. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. When did you start working there? 



E. C. FLOREZ: In the depot, 1930. 



SUSAN ROGERS: So that's when you __________? 



E. C. FLOREZ: I, yeah, now I start in <Williams> in 1925. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, and you worked at the depot until you retired? 



E. C. FLOREZ: Same (?) huh? 



SUSAN ROGERS: You worked at the depot until you retired? 



E. C. FLOREZ: Yeah, the time until I retired, yeah. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Okay and what did you actually do every day? 



E. C. FLOREZ: Well I had to keep everything moving and all the merchandise for the town meat, bread, milk, all the goods, fruits and everything for the town. Take the mail off, take it to post office, get the mail from the post office, bring it in, put it on the train, get the money off the train, take it to the banks. When you handle forty thousand dollars in silver, you better have muscles to pick it up, I’ll tell you. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Really. 



E. C. FLOREZ: I tell you, when I got through, I was through, I was all in. And I had so many jobs I had to fill forty-one cars every two hours for the steam engines, rain, shine, and snow. No, that's how come my shoulders- see my knees and my back hurt lifting that heavy stuff, oh. So you can figure out. And I show you somethin, there are very few employee get them. Get close so you can read um. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, these are very nice. Do you want to describe these so that they can hear it on the tape recorder? Tell um what that says, and how you- tell me about you received this. 



E. C. FLOREZ: I can't read it, I can't see. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Okay you want me to read it? These are medals that he has received from Santa Fe, honor awards. 



E. C. FLOREZ: Read here and you tell ‘em what’s means (?). 



SUSAN ROGERS: Okay it says honor award for Santa Fe employee's outstanding achievement in national railroad safety two consecutive years. This ones dated seventy-seventy-one, and the other ones dated 1968. It's another special reward. Can you tell me about how you got those? 



E. C. FLOREZ: Huh? 



SUSAN ROGERS: How did you get those? 



E. C. FLOREZ: The big boss, he gave it to me, he brought um to me, the big bosses. 



SUSAN ROGERS: That's great. 



E. C. FLOREZ: When I was gettin ready to retire, I don't know how in the world the bosses found out the general manager, superintendent, vice-president, everything came by and said, "Tony you done jobs with dignity." I said, about time you come in and tell me. So and so, while we was talkin' an a makin' little jokes and so forth, highway patrol come in. I don't know how in the world fine out. He said Tony put your name here. There's your car, your gun and pistol in the car. You're highway patrol. I say, listen I'm not gonna take nobody that I didn't bother (?). I got her made, and the big fishes laugh at um. Boy they got um laughing, got um happy. So you can figure out. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. You said that sometimes presidents and movie stars came through <Flagstaff>. Do you remember any special times in particular? 



E. C. FLOREZ: In 1926, I think that was the year I took President Roosevelt, you ever heard about him, Roosevelt, in <Williams>? His daughter had a ranch in there, and he's the biggest human being I ever seen in my life. If he didn't weigh five hundred pounds or more, he didn't weigh any. He couldn't walk hardly; he was so crippled, so I put him in a chair. I helped him in a chair and, ah, got along. And his wife was little one like you, had to look way up to his face, and, ah, he sent other men to the place where his daughter come picked her up. They want to take me down there to the place so we can play for um. We played for um and sing for um for a dollar when that was in the depot. But they didn't get me out there because I no drink liquor, no sir, they go broke on liquor and coffee. I used to smoke like a damn fool for twenty years, got me down to where I lost my head, and I couldn't sleep; I couldn't eat. Finally the wife call our doctor, and he make check my lungs, give me some pills, put me to sleep and next day I feel human. No more cigarettes for me. And everybody I see smoking, I tell um so _________________. I was of five men in that depot, five men operators for cigarettes, pipes, cigars. Only gave him thirty days to live. Wouldn't dare touch him. He left the little ones and the wife. Oh, oh, oh. Then, that those years in <Flagstaff> we had the Santa Fe Trailway, which is the Continental Trailways now. The ticket man said, "Tony", he says, "You better leave", of course, I six months ago, he say I was around six months. He says, thick blood, no other blood out of my mouth, throwing up. Ah, I say, you better stop then. He wasn't through telling me when _________________ was the blood in his mouth. He was dead in ten days. But he quit smokin'. So that's it. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Really. What about any movie stars that came through. Do you remember any particular ones? 



E. C. FLOREZ: Yeah, we had a lot of movie faces, but I can't remember their names. Ho ho, talked to um and sing for um and everything, but I can't remember names. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Ah, do you remember any big fires or floods or blizzards that especially affected the railroad? 



E. C. FLOREZ: What’s that? 



SUSAN ROGERS: Any fires or floods or blizzards that affected you, <Flagstaff> and the railroad? 



E. C. FLOREZ: Well, when we see, when we- I see anything wrong, I call up there, the law, to go check on him right away. Same way anybody'd come in that depot when I'm there, and I seen um drunk he'd be in jail. Don't drink. You know people, you ever have them in your life, see em. I have to pick them up feet by feet, put um in the box after talkin' to um not to go across the tracks. How you think of that? One time an old man comin' in I was standin' out there watchin' the train. I told him it was a train comin', and he said I'm standing right here. First thing he walk right in front of the engine, hit his head. Front end like that hit him again deader than a doornail. So next morning, number three used to get here by 9:50, 9:30, 9:50 in the morning. She was a passenger train. I seen a guy, a tall guy, a Mexican fellow about six, seven feet tall, drunker than _______. I whistled, whistled- and knocked him thirty feet high up in the air deader than a doornail. ________ I couldn't do anything, because I had my trucks for the stop waiting for me (?) so next morning the same train from the same direction, it waited opposite the tracks, took off right in the middle of the train and here it come, took the car _________ ______________ ____________ crossing. Killed his wife, and him, he ain't got a scratch. I tell you, I whistle and whistled at um like I did the day before yesterday. Oh yi yi, but they don't mind. They don't give a hoot. They don't care. Ever time I go do it there I cross tracks, and I tell um no (?), 'cause they're to blame. We got the sign over there, better stop. For once you get in there you can't get out till they come here and pick um up and throw out so far. Well that's all I can tell you. It's all I can know. But Santa Fe is the best thing to travel in. You get in the train, of course it's nothing like it used to be, but what trains you got now. This ____________ permits so you can ride the train and, ah, like the early days, we had no way to lose, because we had a train every hour or two hours, either way. 



SUSAN ROGERS: What were the trains like then? What did they look like inside? 



E. C. FLOREZ: The same, better than what is now. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Really. 



E. C. FLOREZ: Oh yeah, and how. Beautiful, nice and clean. Yeah, nothing like they got now. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Ah, when you started working in <Flagstaff>, was this a new depot or did you start ________? 



E. C. FLOREZ: That depot was built 1924. 



SUSAN ROGERS: So it was built when you came here. 



E. C. FLOREZ: Yeah. That was what they wanted me there for. So I was ready to come for um. 



SUSAN ROGERS: You don't remember any big blizzards that happened? 



E. C. FLOREZ: Any what? 



SUSAN ROGERS: Big blizzards, big snows? 



E. C. FLOREZ: No. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Nothing in particular. Ah, how did the Depression affect <Flagstaff> and the railroads in the 1930s? 



E. C. FLOREZ: The Depression you mean? 



SUSAN ROGERS: The Depression? 



E. C. FLOREZ: Well it didn't hurt the railroads or nobody then. Everything was moving nice. Everything was going pretty well (?). 



SUSAN ROGERS: You yourself didn't really feel the Depression? 



E. C. FLOREZ: Um umm. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, what about World War II? 



E. C. FLOREZ: What do you mean, World War II? 



SUSAN ROGERS: How did it affect <Flagstaff> in the 1940s? 



E. C. FLOREZ: It wasn't a quiet town, but very happy. 



SUSAN ROGERS: It was. 



E. C. FLOREZ: A lot happier than it is now. This town is dead on Sundays; Saturdays and Sundays, dead. In those days, we had to- we play for everybody in the streets, for square dances and regular dances down town. 



SUSAN ROGERS: There in the street? 



E. C. FLOREZ: Yeah. They block one block and everybody had a good time. And now everything is dead. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Who put the dances on? 



E. C. FLOREZ: Oh, the musicians or some of the store businessman, city . 



SUSAN ROGERS: Ah, did you used to ever go to <Oak Creek> then? 



E. C. FLOREZ: Huh? 



SUSAN ROGERS: Did you used to ever go to <Oak Creek>? 



E. C. FLOREZ: Oh yeah. 



SUSAN ROGERS: What was that like? 



E. C. FLOREZ: Beautiful. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Can you describe one of your trips down there? 



E. C. FLOREZ: There are beautiful roads and everything down <Oak Creek>. 



SUSAN ROGERS: There was. huh? 



E. C. FLOREZ: Nothing there now. It's packed up with people now. 



SUSAN ROGERS: What about the <Grand Canyon>? 



E. C. FLOREZ: <Grand Canyon> is a beautiful place, but quite dangerous. Now and then, furthermore the older you get the worst danger it is. Now when us- when I was in <Williams>, people goin' to the <Grand Canyon>, I tell ‘em not to get near the rims unless they have pipes holdin', to hold on to, stand on. Because several people went down suddenly, rocks, and down they went with rocks, miles down, and they had an awful time gettin' um out half dead. A lot of people didn't mind; they didn't care. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Ah, did you go up to the Peaks at all? 



E. C. FLOREZ: Oh, once in a while, not too often. 



SUSAN ROGERS: What was the road like up there? 



E. C. FLOREZ: What it wasn't very good when the road you took over there, if you had to go to the _________ buggy, four wheels trying (?) to get on top. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Did you used to travel on the trains quite a bit? 



E. C. FLOREZ: Hum? 



SUSAN ROGERS: Did you used to travel on the trains quite a bit? 



E. C. FLOREZ: At that time yeah, if I had a chance to get away, I'd get on a train to <San Diego>, <Los Angeles> and so forth. But these other train, no more unless I have to somethin' very important. I've got my pass and everything. 



SUSAN ROGERS: But you don't like um anymore?
