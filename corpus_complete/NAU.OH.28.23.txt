The interview is being conducted on January 27, 1976 on North Fourth Street in <Cottonwood>, which is his home. The interviewer is Susan L. Rogers, representing the Flagstaff City/Coconino County Public Library.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, Mr. Harris, when and where were you born?

DEWEY HARRIS: I was born in <Tempe> in 1898.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, and do you want to tell me a little bit about your parents' background, how they ended up in <Arizona>?

DEWEY HARRIS: Well they just came out of <California>. ______ ______. When they first came across, my father, he was in <Texas> and my mother's folks was from <Missouri>, and they come (sic) across in a wagon train down through by <Tucson> and out through the valley to <Phoenix> and the valley there. And then they went on over to <California> around, oh Downey, right in that section of the country there. And <Long Beach>. And later, I don't know just when, then they come back and located in around <Tempe>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. And what did your father do?

DEWEY HARRIS: As I remember, he was cattle inspector there in <Tempe>. That's what I remember. (Laughs.)

SUSAN ROGERS: Fine. Okay. Do you want to give me a short sketch of your life and how you ended up in <Flagstaff>?

DEWEY HARRIS: Well, I followed construction work along in the early part of the twenties. And I just- from one place to another over the state, and then after World War II, we just happened to- well my wife's daughter, her husband was there at <Parks>. So we come up there, and then we bought a place there in Government Prairie. And that's just how we happened to get up there. And from there, we, we stayed there until along in there four to forty-nine, fifty when the big snow come, and right after that we went and spent a year down there in <Arkansas>, which didn't help anything. And then we come back, and we stayed out at <Mormon Lake> for a little while, about a year, and then we bought a home there on Sixth Street there in East Flag.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. Do you want to tell me a little bit about Government Prairie? Did you have neighbors out there at all? Did you live on a ranch, or what?

DEWEY HARRIS: At the time we moved out there, there were quite a few people lived out there. 'Cause anytime anybody- that's when people used to give parties and then go to the school for their dances, and we did dance there, dances there at <Maine>, well at <Parks> what it is, Parks School house. And, well, we- there was just lots of lots of people there that ain't there now.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. Now what did you do while you worked there? I mean-

DEWEY HARRIS: We had a little farm; we had a few cows, chickens, pigs and what not. And-

SUSAN ROGERS: Now what crops did you grow?

DEWEY HARRIS: Well we growed (sic) oats mostly, that was about the only crop we could grow. Oh, did some corn, but not- oats was the main crop. And then while we were out there, we run a little old sawmill for a while, see.

SUSAN ROGERS: And what went on at the sawmill. Did you work there yourself or-?

DEWEY HARRIS: Sure.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, can you tell be a little bit about that?

DEWEY HARRIS: Well, I can tell you one thing, it's a lot of work. (Both laugh). No, it was all right. It was something new, and we enjoyed it most of those years we was there in it. And, when the big snow come, then we sold out at the ______ Prairie there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now did you-?

DEWEY HARRIS: Went to <Arkansas>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you sell this lumber to somebody; to a bigger company or what?

DEWEY HARRIS: Yeah, we sold it to Falwell(?) Coal(?), and it was shipped to <Texas>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. And then later on you said you lived down at <Mormon Lake>.

DEWEY HARRIS: That’s right.

SUSAN ROGERS: Can you tell me a little bit about that?

DEWEY HARRIS: Oh, when we come back from <Arkansas>, my daughter and her husband was living out there at <Mormon Lake>, so we never had any place so we just landed there, see.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. Uh huh.

DEWEY HARRIS: Then we did- when they was putting in the power line and the power out that way, we run a little old restaurant out there at <Mormon Lake> for the power company, you know, to take care of the fellow’s _____. And then later on, we did try to run another mill out there that didn't succeed very good, so that's how we moved back, moved in to <Flagstaff>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. And then that's when you moved into East Flag?

DEWEY HARRIS: Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. What year was that about?

DEWEY HARRIS: It must have been about fifty-three I guess. But I never worked for the highway, I worked for the city while I was there, but I've done a lot of highway work on construction work.

SUSAN ROGERS: Right. On construction. Okay. Let me ask you some questions about East Flag now. How many people were out there at that time? Was it pretty sparse or...?

DEWEY HARRIS: Well that was before there was ever any school out there. That was a little pasture, bean patch. And there weren't nothing but a little second hand place in there where Babbitts' is by, run by Mr. Day. And all that was just kind of farming country in there, and clear back out to the fox farm. And it was pretty, not too many people scattered around there in East Flag at that time.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now, did you have a little farm when you lived there, or not?

DEWEY HARRIS: Nope.

SUSAN ROGERS: You were just in a house, huh. Did you live in one of these houses that had been moved over from the main part of <Flagstaff>, or did you live in a newer house?

DEWEY HARRIS: No. We bought a place that had a home that was already built, and it was Gofadino’s(?) home. And then on that same block, half block, we bought another place on the other corner that was built there. But we never moved anything from ______. Well, I did move a little two room house that I had out there at <Mormon Lake>, that I moved on to that piece of property.

SUSAN ROGERS: Into East Flag. Now, you said- was it Sixth Street you said?

DEWEY HARRIS: On Sixth Street and- it'd be Second Avenue.

SUSAN ROGERS: Second Avenue. Now, at this time what was East Flag called? Was it called "Sunnyside" or anything then or not?

DEWEY HARRIS: (Laughs). That's out east(?). In Sunnyside.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. And do you know how it got that name?

DEWEY HARRIS: No. I never even asked. But I guess because it was the sunny side of the hill or something there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah.

DEWEY HARRIS: I don't know why, really why.

SUSAN ROGERS: About, what kind of crops were they growing out there mainly? Do you remember or not?

DEWEY HARRIS: Well, out in that section of the country it was, it was a bean country. More- 'course they raised oats, seemed to have been about the best; some wheat and some corn. And when we first got out there, they were still raising potatoes, too, which is- ain't either beans or potatoes or anything else growing out there now, I don't think.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. Okay. Now you said that you worked for the city road construction, you mean like-?

DEWEY HARRIS: Well, I worked for the street department.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Do you want to tell me exactly what you did then?

DEWEY HARRIS: Well, when I first started, I worked as a laborer there on the streets.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now how many were paved? Were they all paved at that time or-?

DEWEY HARRIS: Well, not all. I don't know, but they weren't, weren't a whole lot of pavement in there. Some of the main streets were, but they didn't, they didn't go very far. That is just about to the college or- and then about up to where the high school is, and then from about the high school over to Agassiz, and that was just about the city when I started working.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Now how many years did you work for them?

DEWEY HARRIS: Oh, I worked for them enough out to get a ten-year button.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Did you work on some of the highways at all?

DEWEY HARRIS: I worked on the streets there, 'cause I helped put in a lot of that curb and gutter and sidewalks in the city. And a lot of drain pipes, and on three- we called them "Three Bridges" that went in there.

SUSAN ROGERS: And when did those go in, what year’s about? Do you remember?

DEWEY HARRIS: I really don't. And I don't remember when we enlarged the hangar out at the airport. We enlarged the big hangar there; extended it with the rockwork on it, and then we built a couple metal hangars out there for small planes.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now, were there any other big projects you remember working on?

DEWEY HARRIS: No, I don't know of anything that really amounted to anything more than, oh I don't know, nothing much.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. When you lived in East Flag, were there a lot of Indians living in that area at all, do you remember?

DEWEY HARRIS: I don't think there were.

SUSAN ROGERS: There weren't any at all.

DEWEY HARRIS: No ma'am.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. What about any other minority groups? Do you remember very many in <Flagstaff>, maybe the blacks or the Chinese ?

DEWEY HARRIS: No ma'am. I don't think they was, when I was there, I don't think there was any blacks out there, unless it was- no I don't know of anywhere they lived.

SUSAN ROGERS: You don't remember any. Okay.

DEWEY HARRIS: But there were quite a few Mexicans begin to move out there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Were there?

DEWEY HARRIS: _______ when I left. Ah, sixty. That's when we sold out there; we left there in about sixty-five.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you live down here since?

DEWEY HARRIS: Sixty-six.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. Ten years down here, huh?

DEWEY HARRIS: Yes ma'am.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Did you used to ever attend those Fourth of July celebrations?

DEWEY HARRIS: Yes ma'am. I used to.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember anything in particular about it?

DEWEY HARRIS: Well, no, I don't think they have changed as far as their programs has changed a whole lot than what they were to start with. Of course it's- the carnivals are larger and their exhibits are more, too. But that's all, and the price of admission has jumped up.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember what it was at that time at all?

DEWEY HARRIS: I don't know, but poor people could go see it.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

DEWEY HARRIS: But it hasn't changed anymore than the price of everything else, right?

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah, right.

DEWEY HARRIS: If you've seen it a good many times, maybe you kind of hesitated about paying a big price for something that you've already seen a number of times.

SUSAN ROGERS: Right, right. Okay. Now when you were living in the <Flagstaff> area, do you remember any big fires, or any fires in particular?

DEWEY HARRIS: No, the only one fire that I can remember or- and it hasn't been, twelve weeks(?) when the southwest mill come and burned down there. And that's the only fire that I ever know that really was a fire; bad fire.

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah. Did you go and see that burn down?

DEWEY HARRIS: Well, I could see it, but I didn't go over to it. But I've seen where it was, or seen it along the road there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. Okay. What about any big floods?

DEWEY HARRIS: Nothing that was too bad, but I've seen quite a bit of water run through town. But nothing that destroyed anything, you know. I've seen it flood the streets, and mud get into some buildings, but not to do a whole lot of damage.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. Do you remember one particular time you said when the mud got into the buildings now.

DEWEY HARRIS: No, I can't.

SUSAN ROGERS: You can't remember what year? Okay. And, there's always been big snowfalls in <Flagstaff>, but do you remember anyone in particular?

DEWEY HARRIS: Well, I really don't know of any, but I know- seemed like there used to- or a few years ago before I left, we had a lot more snow than we've had the last three or four years.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now did this cause any problems for you living in East Flag getting into the main part of town, ever?

DEWEY HARRIS: How's that?

SUSAN ROGERS: Did the snow ever cause any problems from getting in from East Flag into the west part of town?

DEWEY HARRIS: No, it really didn't. While I was out there, because they kept the roads, the highway was plowed and then the county-city would get those few little streets there in East Flag to start with over out so it was no problem. And then later when the city taken it over, East Flag was plowed just as quick as the main streets of <Flagstaff>, or any of those other streets, ‘cause the crews went both ways.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Do you remember any crimes?

DEWEY HARRIS: No, I don't remember any that good.

SUSAN ROGERS: You don't remember any thing. Okay. During that time, did you used to make any trips down to <Oak Creek> at all? Did you ever work on the roads going out of town at all?

DEWEY HARRIS: Yes. I have worked on that highway, on the <Oak Creek> Highway out of Flag. That was before I ever moved up to Flag.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, it was?

DEWEY HARRIS: Yes ma'am.

SUSAN ROGERS: Where did you live at that time then?

DEWEY HARRIS: I think when I worked on that, I stayed in Flag, but I lived in <Tempe> at that time when I was working there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. But you would go into <Flagstaff> for every night and stay there?

DEWEY HARRIS: No, it was just out of Flag, not too far.

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah. Did you have a house, or were you staying in a motel or-?

DEWEY HARRIS: I was staying in a little motel.

SUSAN ROGERS: What one was that? Do you remember or not?

DEWEY HARRIS: (Undecipherable response).

SUSAN ROGERS: You can't-

DEWEY HARRIS: I don't remember, I don't know, it might have been one of Saginaw's old little houses. I ain't sure; I don't remember just where I did stay.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Were there any other roads that you remember working on around <Flagstaff>?

DEWEY HARRIS: Well I worked on the road from Cameron on north for a section in there, but that was along in the early thirties.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. So did you live in a camp at that time?

DEWEY HARRIS: I lived in a camp out there.

SUSAN ROGERS: And how many people lived in the camp, about?

DEWEY HARRIS: Oh, there was probably forty or fifty people working out there at that time.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. And then you would just stay there all week, or did you get to come into town once a week, or what?

DEWEY HARRIS: We'd come in every- once a week, I guess, if we wanted to or went some place; just whatever we felt that we wanted to do.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

DEWEY HARRIS: 'Cause we seldom ever worked on Sunday at that time.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. So would you come into <Flagstaff>, or would you used to go to Cameron, or-

DEWEY HARRIS: Well there was nothing there but a little station there at Cameron, a lot littler than it is now. We'd come into <Flagstaff>. Flag was about the only town that really was anything then.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh. When you came in, what did you do? What kind of entertainment was there to do?

DEWEY HARRIS: I didn't do anything more(?) than anybody that worked on those kind of jobs did. We usually went to the bar.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Would a bunch of you come in together or something?

DEWEY HARRIS: Usually. One, two or three in a car; something like that.

SUSAN ROGERS: Then would you go back; would you return to the camp that same night, or would you stay over here?

DEWEY HARRIS: Lots of times we did. Usually we did.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Now do you want to tell me a little about how you met your wife; maybe a little bit of her background?

DEWEY HARRIS: Well I met her over at Lukeville(?). I was working over there; I was running a shovel over there. She happened to be there, because her daughter was there and her husband, and he happened to be my oiler(?). So that's the way I happened to meet her.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

DEWEY HARRIS: And then met her again in <Tucson>. She was from <New Mexico>, <Ruidoso New Mexico>. So that's how I happened to meet her on these jobs. And then later, when I was working up at <Miami> there for the mining, when they opened up that open pit mine at <Miami>, that's where we were married there. We was married in Safford. She come there.

SUSAN ROGERS: What year was that?

DEWEY HARRIS: Was that '42.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

DEWEY HARRIS: I know sometimes you remember it, but I sure didn't remember I did. (Both laugh).

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Do you remember any famous people that came through <Flagstaff> at all? Either, you know, movie stars, musicians, anything like that; scientists?

DEWEY HARRIS: No, I really I don't. I do know, I knew some of the people there in Flag that furnished horses, wagons, and things like that for the movies that come in there. But that's about the only people that I ever got in contact with.

SUSAN ROGERS: Were there quite a few movies being filmed in the area at that time?

DEWEY HARRIS: I think there was. There was one, seemed like <Monument Valley> was one place where they filmed some. Seemed to have been about the main place. Well, I don't know, I never got too much interested in following the movies although I rented them a team of horses and wagon and that. But that was as far as I was connected with them.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Well you've just about answered most of my questions here. Can you think of anything you want to add, ______. I had a note here that said something about your wife used to cook for the loggers that came out of town, do you know anything about that?

DEWEY HARRIS: Yes ma'am. She used to cook for Southwest Lumber Company when they had their camps out by <Mormon Lake> and on out through there when they was logging all that. That was before I ever knew her. But she did.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now did she travel around to the camps, you mean, or did she stay in one camp for a certain amount of time?

DEWEY HARRIS: Well wherever that- they ah, where they were logging at that time, see. 'Cause they had- I think they had cars that was, more or less their mess halls and that too, see.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh.

DEWEY HARRIS: And then-

END TAPE 1, SIDE 1, BEGIN TAPE 1, SIDE 2

DEWEY HARRIS: Later on she run the cafeteria over here at Jerome when that was going good.

SUSAN ROGERS: All right!

DEWEY HARRIS: When that was going good. Now don't ask me when, should know, too, 'cause my sister taught out there. And they happen to meet there just that way, 'cause my sister was a teacher and she run the cafeteria, so they was acquainted that way, so that was before ever I knew that either one of them knew one another, see.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, uh huh. Okay. Is there anything you want to add?

DEWEY HARRIS: I don’t know.

SUSAN ROGERS: You can't think of anything. Okay.
