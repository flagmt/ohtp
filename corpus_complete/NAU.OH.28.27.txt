This is an interview with Mr. and Mrs. Carmen and David Lay. They are both <Flagstaff> natives and were born here in 1918. David Lay is the vice-president of Babbitt Trading Company. The interview is being conducted on January 20, 1976, at 2304 Talkington Drive, which is their <Flagstaff> home. The interviewer is Susan L. Rogers representing the Flagstaff City-Coconino County Public Library.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, Mrs. Lay, we'll start with you first. When and where were your born?

CARMEN LAY: Here in <Flagstaff>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, do you want to give me a little bit about your parents' background and your mother's maiden name, and how they came to <Flagstaff>?

CARMEN LAY: Well, my parents were from the old country. My father came from the Pyrenees. He is Basque. My mother came from <Spain>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, now why did they end up in <Flagstaff>? Were they born here?

CARMEN LAY: No, no, they came from <Spain>. [comment obscured by a second recording on top of this interview--sounds like a CB radio (Tr.)]

SUSAN ROGERS: So they met each other in <Spain>?

CARMEN LAY: No, here.

SUSAN ROGERS: You don't know how they ended up in <Flagstaff>? The reason they came?

CARMEN LAY: No, no I couldn’t (CB radio again).

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, what was your mother's maiden name?

CARMEN LAY: Gomez.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you know what year they were born, or where they settled, or anything like that, that they told you?

CARMEN LAY: No.

SUSAN ROGERS: How about yourself? Where did you live when you were little- the actual house is what I'm talking about?

CARMEN LAY: At 206 West Benton. That is where my father still lives.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh! Okay, so the house is still standing?

CARMEN LAY: Yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: And you were completely raised your total life there.

CARMEN LAY: Yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, why don't we find out a little briefing on Mr. Lay here? You also were born on <Flagstaff>. Can you tell me a little bit about YOUR parents' background?

DAVID LAY: Well, let's see my mother came from <Chicago>. Her maiden name was Rosen. She's still living in <Flagstaff>, on West Birch. She's eighty-four at the present time. My father came from <Tennessee>, and he was about fifteen when he came out. He settled in the <Sedona> area, and then he later moved into the <Flagstaff> area, and had a ranch out around <Winona>. I was born in <Flagstaff> here. And then he had that for several years, and then he opened a grocery story in the west end of <Flagstaff>. I attended the local schools here. He passed away in '58. He was eighty-six. He came out here in about 1887.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. He came out in 1887. Did he settle-

DAVID LAY: He settled in the <Sedona> area.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay and then moved up here. And I asked you what his occupation was.

CARMEN LAY: Well, he was a sheepherder, what he did then. Later on, he was a chef. When he retired, he was cooking at the county jail, he was the cook there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did he ever tell you any interesting stories about any of the prisoners or anything like that?

CARMEN LAY: No, because he didn't come in contact with them himself.

SUSAN ROGERS: What about when he was a sheepherder? Do you remember that, when he was or not?

CARMEN LAY: No, very little of it.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you know what area he herded the sheep? Was he working for a company or what?

CARMEN LAY: Yes. I can't remember the first company he worked for, but he did work for Lockett’s Sheep Company.

SUSAN ROGERS: Right, the Lockett family.

CARMEN LAY: Yes, still exists.

SUSAN ROGERS: Right, so then he was around Mormon Lake, probably.

CARMEN LAY: Yes. And then they would drive the sheep back down to the southern part of the state in the fall and back up here in the spring.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did he tell you about the sheep drives? Did they ever have any problems with cattle people at all?

CARMEN LAY: No.

SUSAN ROGERS: They got along all right in this area?

CARMEN LAY: There probably weren't too many cattlemen, were there?

SUSAN ROGERS: Mainly sheep then, huh?

DAVID LAY: Carmen I don’t know.

CARMEN LAY: They probably didn't interfere with each other, though.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh-huh, did he used to ever tell you about these sheep drives. Can you remember any stories from 'em or anything?

CARMEN LAY: No, I can't.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, fine. You both went to school here. Did you go to Emerson?

DAVID LAY: I did.

CARMEN LAY: I went to the college school, the grade school. What did they call that in those days?

SUSAN ROGERS: The Normal School?

DAVID LAY: That's what it was.

CARMEN LAY: Probably. Probably the Normal School, but they had the grade school there also. And then from there, I went to Nativity.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Can you tell me a little bit maybe about your teachers and discipline, homework, anything like that? Any particular teachers that stand out in your mind? Can’t remember anything? No, now where was that school held, exactly?

CARMEN LAY: What do you mean?

SUSAN ROGERS: The one that was held on the campus. Do you remember what building it was in?

CARMEN LAY: Oh, I don't believe that building is there anymore. It was a very small building. As I recall, it was north of the - Old Main they call it now, don't they?

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh-huh, right.

CARMEN LAY: And apparently that was torn down. And then the Nativity School was where the new one is now.

SUSAN ROGERS: Right, okay. Now, did you go to Emerson?

DAVID LAY: Yes, I did. I started in at Emerson. There's still two of the people living that I started with. I can't remember, we had maybe twenty in the class. Let's see, Mrs. Mike D'Mura started to school with me - Betty Jo. (aside about phone) She was one of the first ones I went to school with. Some of the teachers that taught me are still here. Mr. Killip came into high school, I think when I was a freshman. Some of the old-time teachers from the grade school, I don't believe they're alive anymore. We had some real fine teachers.

SUSAN ROGERS: Any particular one that stands out in your mind? Or the principal? Who was the principal, do you remember?

DAVID LAY: Well, let's see, I would probably go back, maybe to Miss Datson(?). She was one of the real fine teachers we had in school. And let's see, we had a principal that's no longer here. I don't know where he ever ended up. I think Miss Datson was probably one of the best teachers.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, can you tell me a little bit more about her? What were her teaching principles, or how'd she treat the students?

DAVID LAY: I don't know why I really remember her better than some of the others. I think maybe it was just her manner of getting things done from the class. Very easy-going. Very firm, but she always accomplished her objectives. And I liked her.

SUSAN ROGERS: Was there any kind of competition between the Catholic schools and Emerson? I’m talking about maybe sports or something like that.

CARMEN LAY: I don't think there was _______.

DAVID LAY: There wasn't too much activity at the grade school level at that time. We had a little intramural activity, but very limited. High school is where it developed.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, as a child, can you tell me just your daily activities that you did in <Flagstaff>; some, maybe the games that you played, little bit about your neighborhood friends at all. What you did after school, if you had chores around the house.

DAVID LAY: I don't think we were much different from the kids of today. I was raised with a lot of the boys that are still in <Flagstaff>: Larry Gold at the hospital, Frank Michelbach, let’s see- Tom Tissaw. We did very much the same things that kids do today: skiing, tobogganing in the winter, football in the fall. We weren't any different. Fishing in the summer, maybe camping. I think we were a little closer to the out-of-doors in the summer. There weren't as many things to do as a child. You had to make your own (CB radio again) pleasures, let's say. Did a lot of camping, a lot of hiking, a lot of picnics.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Now when you did this camping, was this your family?

DAVID LAY: A lot of it was by ourselves, a lot of the boys we used to go out sometimes be gone for a week, maybe two weeks.

SUSAN ROGERS: Where did you usually go?

DAVID LAY: Oh, Lake Mary, <Oak Creek> , lots of times up to the Peaks.

SUSAN ROGERS: When you went up on the Peaks, did you go on that Weatherford road? Or how did you get up there?

DAVID LAY: No, we used to go to about the top of the ski tow. It was the old Spruce Cabin Road. We'd  usually stay in there and then hiked up to the top __________.

SUSAN ROGERS: How about you, Mrs. Lay, remember any particular childhood activities?

CARMEN LAY: No, mine wasn't as interesting as Mr. Lay's, I assure you. With girls, you know, it's different.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you have any special stories around the house. I didn’t even ask you how many brothers and sisters there were in your family. Do you want to tell me how many there were, and where they are now, what they're doing? (much interference from  radio)

CARMEN LAY: Well, let's see, there was one brother, one sister, and then I have a younger brother. My older brother has passed away, and my sister is Mary Gerrard. She lives here in <Flagstaff>. And my younger brother is Peter Martin, and he lives in <Phoenix>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. What about you, Mr. Lay?

DAVID LAY: Well, let's see, I have one sister and one brother. They're both living in <Flagstaff>. My brother is with the <Coconino County> as the assistant engineer. My sister is married to Keith Hunter, who is retired from the Forest Service.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Now, what about some of those early Pow Wows and Fourth of Julys? Do you remember those at all? Tell me a little bit about what you did on that day.

DAVID LAY: The early Pow Wows? Well, I can remember some of those. I don't think they've changed too much. The crowds are a lot larger now. The old Pow Wow was very similar, the races in the afternoon.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you want me to turn that off?

DAVID LAY: And the dances in the evening. We had a lot of wagons, which you don't see now, in the parades anymore. But basically, I think there was a lot of similarity.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember the Days of '49 that were right before the Pow Wow, at all?

DAVID LAY: That was Prescott. The Days were brought in out of Prescott. Forty-niners? Yes, I remember those.

SUSAN ROGERS: What were they like?

DAVID LAY: Well, that went more to your cowboy type of entertainment. It didn't have the Indians, it had the cowboys with six-shooters and so on and so forth - a regular rodeo.

SUSAN ROGERS: Where was that held usually?

DAVID LAY: Those were held in the City Park at that time. And the parade used to start up on West Birch, and they used to go from there to the downtown area.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember the prohibition era at all? Do you have any big bootlegging stories of the area at all? I’ve been surprised by how many we are getting.

CARMEN LAY: No, I don't.

DAVID LAY: I don't remember any real good ones. I know my father didn't drink, but I remember some of the places he used to go to get a pint or something like that, when he had the flu.

CARMEN LAY: A little cold or something?

DAVID LAY: Flu, I think. Most of 'em were east of town, out in some of the areas we called the Old Bean Fields. I remember those, sure do.

SUSAN ROGERS: What are the Old Bean Fields now? Is that another name for Sunnyside?

DAVID LAY: No, that's further out. That would take in Black Bill Park and Doney Park, those areas.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, and people out there growing beans apparently?

DAVID LAY: Yes, grew a lot of pinto beans in that area.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. At the same time, the Depression was going on. How do you think that affected <Flagstaff>, or maybe personally your family? (husband and wife talking together, too faint to decipher)

DAVID LAY: I don't believe it was necessarily OUR family - I think it was everyone. And I remember some of the other people in <Flagstaff>. Things were very cheap. I know you didn't have a lot of money, we didn't have the things that you would have nowadays. I don't know, a depression's a depression. Pretty hard to explain.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. What about the effect of World War II on <Flagstaff>? Do you remember any particular-?

DAVID LAY: Now, we were gone over World War II. We were living in the Bay Area, San Francisco and <Oakland>, during the war years. The few trips we made home were very, very short duration. I couldn't say much about that period.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. What about any big fires you remember? Either from your childhood or later on. Any particular ones?

DAVID LAY: I guess the biggest one I remember is when the mill burned.

CARMEN LAY: I was going to say the sawmill.

SUSAN ROGERS: And what year is that, about? (pause) In the thirties, the forties- you know, something like that.

DAVID LAY: I would say that was in the thirties. That was probably the biggest fire I remember in <Flagstaff>.

SUSAN ROGERS: At that time, do you remember, did the sawmill have its own fire department? Or how did they end up putting it out? Did it burn to the ground, or what?

DAVID LAY: Well, that did burn to the ground, but I believe it was a combination of the city at that time, and the lumber company also had their own preventative maintenance in this area. But that did destroy the sawmill.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. What about any big floods? Do you remember any? Apparently the Rio de Flag used to flood its banks on occasion.

CARMEN LAY: Oh, I remember THAT one.

DAVID LAY: It didn't really amount to much.

CARMEN LAY: It didn't amount to much, but in the area where WE lived, it was lower and flatter and there weren't a lot of homes in there. And it was just one big lake there. I know they asked all the people to move out of there. And WE had to move and stay with friends for just, oh, a few days, as I remember.

SUSAN ROGERS: What year was that, about?

CARMEN LAY: Oh, heavens!

SUSAN ROGERS: You can just give a general idea and someone can always try to look it up more.

CARMEN LAY: Gosh, I must have been, what, maybe ten years old.

SUSAN ROGERS: The late twenties maybe, huh.

CARMEN LAY: I imagine it was around that time. But it really didn't amount to that much. It's just that there was no way of gettin' in and out into your home.

SUSAN ROGERS: So you did have to leave, though, for a couple of days, huh?

CARMEN LAY: Well, for a few days we moved out - that whole neighborhood had to.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now, at that time, how many houses were in that neighborhood, do you remember?

CARMEN LAY: Oh, golly, there weren't very many, 'cause I can remember that was just one big field out there, between us and the college. And that's all built up, you know, now.

SUSAN ROGERS: Right.

CARMEN LAY: In fact, I think on OUR block there was only from Milton Road to Beaver Street, there must have been four houses on that one side of the street. And across the street, there weren't any homes.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Mr. Lay, what about YOUR neighborhood, where you lived?

DAVID LAY: Well, let's see, in my neighborhood, we lived in the west end of town. And I remember the time when the streets were not paved. We had downtown, a lot of the sidewalks were board sidewalks. Let's see, the lot where the Monte Vista is, I can still remember that thing was probably about ten feet deep. I remember a Model "T" being down in there, turned over. That was just a real, real big dropoff there. Let's see, there was a hitching post downtown at that time. A lot of the old-timers used to come in their wagons. You know, these are the days that are way back. And I remember the hills between <Flagstaff> and East Flag, in the area where El Rancho is now.  These were a red-type clay, and when we got a lot of snow or rain or anything, you couldn't hardly get out there. And East <Flagstaff>, as we know it now, that was nothing more than, oh, a homestead or two in there. And let's see, where the Ramada is right now, and the Pine Grove Market, that area in there, that was nothing but a little campground with four or five little old cabins and a little tiny store.  And there wasn't much between there and <Flagstaff>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Now, was it called Sunnyside when you were small?

DAVID LAY: That area out there, let’s see, that was called.... Not Pine Knob. What was the name of that? (pause) See, I can't remember that particular name, but the area where Smokerise is, that was Cliffs [phonetic spelling]. There was a sawmill out there.

SUSAN ROGERS: That was the Greenlaw Sawmill, right?

DAVID LAY: That was the Greenlaw, and IT burned. This was when I was a pretty small boy. I remember that. The area that Smokerise sits on was a large ranch in there, and that was owned by the Bates. But I can't remember what the other areas were between there and Flag, [what they] were called, but there weren't very many, very few.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, back to natural disasters. <Flagstaff>'s had a lot of big snows. Is there any particular one that you remember being bigger than the rest and affecting you?

CARMEN LAY: ’49, wasn’t it? [Abstract indicates 1949 (Tr.)]

DAVID LAY: That was probably the worst one as far as WE were concerned.

SUSAN ROGERS: What happened in that one?

DAVID LAY: Well, I think that was the year that we had - I think we shoveled more snow off of the roof than I've ever shoveled. (laughter) And I think we had maybe poor street maintenance at that time. Things were pretty bad there for a few days. Seems like you go home every night and shovel the roof and maybe get a path to the street, so you could get out in the morning. But that was probably the worst.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. What about any crime as children, that left an impression on your mind that you remember reading about or hearing about? (long pause)

DAVID LAY: Probably the one was, Indian Miller out at <Two Guns>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Tell me a little bit more about that. People have made a reference to that, but I haven’t heard too much.

DAVID LAY: Let's see, I was trying to think. He was tried in <Coconino County> for murdering.... I can't remember the man's name, but he also was right there in the <Canyon Diablo> area. He murdered this other gentleman. And I remember my father was on this jury. Let's see, we went out, oh, probably a year after he was standing trial, and we went through his old museum and so on that he had there. As I remember, I was a fairly small kid. I was interested in the wild animals he had caged in under the rim of <Canyon Diablo> itself. And he had three or four lions there that he used to go and handle like they were kittens. Very, very fine fellow. I liked him real much as I was a kid growing up, and I would- he had things I liked.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now, why did he murder this guy? Or what was the story anyway?

DAVID LAY: I can't remember the details on it exactly. I don't remember what they were, but when I looked at the house, you can still see the pockmarks or the little bullet marks on the wall. I don't remember what kind of a gun he used, but they looked awfully big to me. But I don't remember the details of that particular case.

SUSAN ROGERS: Was he actually convicted, or did he get off?

DAVID LAY: No, he was released.

SUSAN ROGERS: He was released?

DAVID LAY: Yes, he was.

SUSAN ROGERS: So, maybe it was self-defense or something?

DAVID LAY: It was a self-defense of some sort.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. What about any water shortages that you remember?

CARMEN LAY: Oh, all I can remember is that there WAS a water shortage, and they used to bring water in from <Winslow> on the train. What did they do? Did they pump it into a big tank or something, down by the tracks?

DAVID LAY: I don't know. We used to get our water up....

CARMEN LAY: At the spring?

DAVID LAY: Used to get it here at the old spring in Old Town. We used to get it out of Tunnel Springs out west of town. And we used to get it right here at the Museum of Northern Arizona.

SUSAN ROGERS: Is that Leroux Springs?

DAVID LAY: No, it’s not Leroux Springs, Leroux Springs, we did get it there, too, and that's up in Fort Valley.

SUSAN ROGERS: But that's not the one that was at the museum.

DAVID LAY: No, we used to get it right here at the Museum of Northern Arizona, the Colton place. But I can remember those rather vividly.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now, did you have to pay for it, or people just went up there and you carried all your buckets?

DAVID LAY: Carry out in gallon jugs usually.

CARMEN LAY: We used to go up to the old spring.

DAVID LAY: The worst thing was waiting for your turn.

SUSAN ROGERS: Lines were pretty long?

DAVID LAY: Pretty long.

SUSAN ROGERS: How often did you have to go?

DAVID LAY: We used to go about every two days.

CARMEN LAY: Of course you had a car - we DIDN'T. We had to walk, so we had to go to the nearest place. I imagine we went every other day or so.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did the whole family go, and they all took a gallon? Or how did it work?

CARMEN LAY: Oh, I don't remember. I can remember I sure used to have to go and lug my little gallon jug.

DAVID LAY: It does seem to me like the whole family would go.

CARMEN LAY: Probably all the family would have to go, to bring home enough.

SUSAN ROGERS: How long did that go on, that you had to do it, go to all those springs?

DAVID LAY: I would hesitate to say, but it seems to me like it was sometimes three and four weeks at a stretch.

SUSAN ROGERS: That was usually in the summer?

DAVID LAY: In the summer months, before the summer rains came.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. As you were growing up, what was the big entertainment? Were there movie houses? Maybe you remember what big social occasions, your parent’s went, any fancy hotels or anything like that - balls or dances.

DAVID LAY: I think when I was a kid about the only thing we had was the movie. I remember a lot of the fellows from MY group, we used to deliver handbills on Saturdays, because of the movies during the week.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now, where did you deliver these? Around to different houses?

DAVID LAY: All over town. Took us all day Saturday.

SUSAN ROGERS: And then you get to go to the-

DAVID LAY: Then we had a pass for the week.

SUSAN ROGERS: So you could go every day, you mean?

DAVID LAY: Every day if we wanted to, but that was usually not the case. Usually once a week.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, and where was the movie theater that you went to?

DAVID LAY: That was where the old Orpheum is.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Where did you usually do your shopping? Were there any neighborhood stores, or did you usually go downtown? I'm talking about, maybe your mother’s grocery shopping, types of things.

CARMEN LAY: Well, of course, YOUR mother didn't.

DAVID LAY: No, father owned the store.

CARMEN LAY: Your dad owned that little store, but I can't remember-

DAVID LAY: But the rest of it used to be a Babbitt Brothers.

CARMEN LAY: I remember going to Babbitts'.

DAVID LAY: That's where it was.

CARMEN LAY: That's right, I can remember going to Babbitts'.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you used to walk?

CARMEN LAY: Yes, we always walked. We didn't have a car.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now, did they have a delivery service at that time?

CARMEN LAY: I don't think they did.

DAVID LAY: They had a delivery service later on, and that was with the wagon. And then wintertime, they had the sled. And the biggest thing I can remember down there, is getting ice. That was the only place to get ice in <Flagstaff>, 'cause they made the ice.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, you said that your father owned a little store. Can you tell me a little bit more about that, and where it was?

DAVID LAY: Well, he owned the store on the west end of <Flagstaff>, so I've been in the grocery business all my life. And prior to that, let's see, he had cattle with his brother along the Rim of <Oak Creek>, in the area, that??s oh, roughly <Munds Park>, James Canyon, and through this area.

SUSAN ROGERS: That's right. I have some questions here for you on <Munds Park>.

DAVID LAY: All right.

SUSAN ROGERS: You had a ranch there; your family did?

DAVID LAY: No, let's see, my father had cattle with his brother in the area. It would be west and south of there. And they had that for some time, and it was his- Let's see, I think the Loys settled in <Munds Park>. They had the ranch, it was the Loy Ranch in <Munds Park>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Is that L-O-Y?

DAVID LAY: L-O-Y.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Can you tell me about, did you used to ever go on trips from here down to <Munds Park>, down to <Oak Creek> or anything?

DAVID LAY: All the time.

SUSAN ROGERS: Staying over at that ranch, can you tell me a little bit about that?

DAVID LAY: I never stayed at <Munds Park>, no. Used to stay at <Oak Creek> quite often, with my grandparents. Now, they were down in the area south of <Cornville>, and I used to go down there a lot when I was a kid.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, tell me a little bit about that, about the trip, compared to today.

DAVID LAY: Well, the trip at that time used to take about four-and-a-half to five hours. If you would go down through <Oak Creek Canyon>. And sometimes you could get through the Schnebly Hill Road, and sometimes you couldn't, depending on how much snow we had on top. But the average trip was usually four-and-a-half, five hours.

SUSAN ROGERS: So would you go like for a weekend or something?

DAVID LAY: Either go down on a Saturday and come back on a Sunday. And then in the summers I used to spend maybe a couple of weeks down.

SUSAN ROGERS: You went down in a car, right, and it took that long?

DAVID LAY: Yes. And I remember my father saying that when he used to come out of <Sedona>, when he-

[END TAPE 1, SIDE 1, BEGIN TAPE 1, SIDE 2]

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, you want to repeat that about your father down in <Sedona>?

DAVID LAY: Well, when he used to homestead in the <Sedona> area, he would be just west of the bridge, and he was adjacent to Mr. and Mrs. George Black. He had the place just north of them. It would take him two days to come to <Flagstaff> with a team of horses and a wagon. And I think he told me they used to stop at <Willard Springs>, which is right in the <Munds Park> area.

SUSAN ROGERS: Dolf(?) Willard?

DAVID LAY: Stay overnight, and then come on up.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh-huh. Okay. Do you remember anything of the Munds family?

DAVID LAY: No, I really don't.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you know anything about the development of that area, who some of the neighbors were at that time, some of the ranches, and how it kind of developed into what it is now at all?

DAVID LAY: Well, let's see, at the time, I used to remember it, there was, let's see, the Loys had the ranch on the west end, and the Burruses were on the east end. And let's see- I can't remember who was at Foxboro. I used to stop in there. So help me, I don't know.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you know if those ranches are still there?

DAVID LAY: Well, they're there in a sense. No, the Burrus property there, where Ernie Burrus and some of the others used to live, that is now the country club, Pinewood. That area has developed into that. And I believe the old Loy house and everything on the west end is still there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Is that that white ranch that you can see from the highway?

DAVID LAY: Yes. And then the ranger station used to be further west of THAT.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Does somebody still live in that ranch, in that_________, or-

DAVID LAY: I'm not sure whether they do or not.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you know anything about the ranches in that area? Or maybe also your father. When they came to <Flagstaff>, where did they put the cattle? Did they ship it from here? Do you remember?

DAVID LAY: No, I sure don't. I know he said they used to go into <Oak Creek>. I'd say that would be where - Pendley, Slide Rock is. Right in there. And in north of there, they used to catch wild cattle in that area, when he first came out. This was in the eighties.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did he ever tell you about coming to <Flagstaff> in those days at all? A little bit what it was like or anything?

DAVID LAY: Not too much, other than it took two days. And they used to come up Schnebly Hill. I guess that was prior to the Oak Creek Road being put up the canyon.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Tell me how you two met and ended up getting married, and how many children you have now.

CARMEN LAY: We had one son. He's sixteen. We were in high school together, and that's where we met and started going together, and were married in 1940, wasn't it?

DAVID LAY: That’s what I said, 1940.

CARMEN LAY: Did you say it?

DAVID LAY: Sure. (laughter)

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. I don't think we've talked about the high school. You want to tell me a little bit about what classes you took there, any teachers in particular you can remember, and any extra curricular activities maybe?

CARMEN LAY: Oh, gosh, they didn't have much in extra-

DAVID LAY: SURE they did, Carmen! They had all the extracurricular activities they have today, except maybe the band. Some of this wasn't quite as elaborate. You had your football, your basketball, and track.

CARMEN LAY: Oh, well yes.

DAVID LAY: Your glee club. All of this, very, very similar to today. (both talking at once)

CARMEN LAY: Of course, I suppose. Seems like they have so much more now.

SUSAN ROGERS: What about drama clubs or different clubs at all?

CARMEN LAY: I don't remember.

DAVID LAY: I never had time for those.

SUSAN ROGERS: Were you in sports in high school?

DAVID LAY: Just football and track.

SUSAN ROGERS: What teams did you usually play?

DAVID LAY: Well, let's see, in high school at that time, they were confined pretty much to the northern part of the state. I guess <Snowflake> probably would be about as far as they would go: <Snowflake>, <Winslow>, <Holbrook>, <Williams>, <Verde Valley>, the Clarkedale. <Jerome> had a team at that time - two schools down there. And that was about the extent of the high school activities at that time was confined pretty much to this area. But it seemed to me like I was always too busy studying, I didn't have time for all that other stuff. Let's see, I don't know who the teachers were. I can remember the Killip came in, Mr. Killip.

CARMEN LAY: And Mrs. Killip.

DAVID LAY: And Joyce. She was Joyce Aston [phonetic spelling] at that time. And let's see, Rollin Wheeler, Coach Wheeler.

CARMEN LAY: Coach Wheeler, Mr. Micke.

DAVID LAY: Mr. Micke was there.

CARMEN LAY: Miss McNurney [phonetic spelling].

DAVID LAY: Miss McNurney, that’s right. These were all real fine people. J.P. Mc Vey was principal at the time.

CARMEN LAY: Yes, right.

SUSAN ROGERS: Is that Killip, is he still alive?

DAVID LAY: Yes.

CARMEN LAY: Oh, yes! He's with the school system.

SUSAN ROGERS: He still is, huh?

DAVID LAY: Yes. I'm not sure of his capacity - I think he was administrator of the city school system now, isn't he?

CARMEN LAY: I don't know what his title is.

DAVID LAY: I believe he is. I'm sure it is.

SUSAN ROGERS: What's his first name, if I can get that?

CARMEN LAY: It's W.M. Killip.

SUSAN ROGERS: W.N.?

DAVID LAY: Wilfred isn't it?

CARMEN LAY: I don't remember what- I think it's W.F.

SUSAN ROGERS: W. F., just so we can get it in the phone book or directory or something.

DAVID LAY: Oh, he's there.

CARMEN LAY: But he's with the Flagstaff Schools - Flagstaff High School up here.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

CARMEN LAY: In the administrative offices there.

DAVID LAY: I don't believe any of those other teachers are still here, except Rollin Wheeler.

SUSAN ROGERS: Yes, we've interviewed him.

DAVID LAY: I think he's the only one left, isn't he, out of that group?

CARMEN LAY: (inaudible) Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Olive McNurney, ___________?

DAVID LAY: Yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did she die?

DAVID LAY: I don't know whether she did or not.

SUSAN ROGERS: Because Minnie Roseberry gave us her name.

DAVID LAY: I don't know whether she has or not, but she was our foreign language teacher, very good.

CARMEN LAY: Very strict, but VERY good teacher.

SUSAN ROGERS: How'd you feel about the discipline? Did you feel it was fair? Did you feel they were too strict, too easy?

DAVID LAY: No, I don't think the discipline was strict - I really don't.

SUSAN ROGERS: What about homework? Did you have the right amount?

CARMEN LAY: It seemed like we had more homework in those days than they do now. You know, it seems like now they have their study period or- No, WE had a study period.

DAVID LAY: I had a study period, but I never got my work all done.

CARMEN LAY: But they don't now. But it seemed like we ALWAYS had homework, where they don't seem to bring so much of it home nowadays.

DAVID LAY: I think the teaching methods were different. Well, I KNOW they were.

CARMEN LAY: Well, they WERE - we KNOW that, very definitely.

DAVID LAY: We didn't have the modern math, we had to learn the times tables, and if you didn't learn the times tables, you just didn't get your work done. And with the modern math, from watching my son, he doesn't know the times tables today, and he seems to get by pretty well, and NO HOMEWORK! I did three times as much as he did in any one day. But I think their teaching methods have changed. I believe they have more lectures. I think they maybe observe and listen more than we did. Ours came pretty much out of a book. I think that's the big difference in the teaching.

SUSAN ROGERS: Can you tell me a little bit about the building that you were in? Not the one that's up there anymore, right?

DAVID LAY: No, that's been demolished.

CARMEN LAY: That hasn't been too many years ago, has it?

DAVID LAY: No, that was just taken down about ten years ago. At that time it was a good-sized building for a high school. Let's see, we had about forty-seven students in the graduating class. And I think the total enrollment of the school was about 240. So we didn't really need a big facility like they have today. And all of the classes were rather small - most of them in the area of maybe thirty students or less. I can't remember an overcrowding in any area. I don't remember how many rooms we had in the building, but there weren't too many. At that time, it was a nice building. It was probably adequate for the need.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Now, do you want to tell me a little bit about your jobs that you had either when you got out of high school or how you got in the Babbitt Company?

DAVID LAY: Well, let's see, I started working on a Saturday in January, for one day.

CARMEN LAY: What a memory!

DAVID LAY: That's right! And let's see, I stayed probably a little over a year, and I wasn't even on the payroll, we just got paid out of the register, part-time help. I went to work for one day, and I worked about four years, and I quit when we went to the coast during the war years, four years. And I came back in October of '45. My wife wanted a beauty shop, so we bought the beauty shop. Therefore, I was stuck in <Flagstaff>. (laughter) I went back to Babbitts' two days later, and I've been there ever since. That's it.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Do you want to tell me, I’m sure you didn’t have the same job at Babbitts' the whole time, and how you ended up with the job that you have, and a little bit about what you do on a daily basis.

DAVID LAY: Well, let's see. Like I say, I started way back, doing just anything that came along. I worked in the produce, I worked in the grocery, a little bit in meat, finally moved and took the little store where Joe's Place is now, and I managed that for two years. I was transferred from there to the main building, and the grocery department was in where the shoe department exists right now. I managed that for maybe three years, something like that. Then we moved into the supermarket on Birch and Leroux. (Ed: Norwest Bank) I managed that for a year-and-a-half. And from that I was given a job as supervisor of the Babbitt grocery operation, and I've held that ever since. In between, why, I have a little different title of vice-president with the company. But I've been with them a little over thirty years this month. And I do everything from the store layout; buying the fixtures, the equipment; do the pricing; the advertising. And I travel the northern part of the state now. I usually make every store at least once a week, if I can, if the schedule isn't too tight.

SUSAN ROGERS: What do you do when you go to the store, do you discuss all this stuff with the managers?

DAVID LAY: Well, we do several things. We have a certain way we like to have our stores run. And it's my job to see that they are run in this fashion. We have two old stores in <Flagstaff>. Our new stores are very modern and up-to-date. We like to maintain a certain type of store for the customer shopping with us. It's my job to see that things are done. When we open a new store, I go from the blueprint stage on through. I do the layout and everything else. Very interesting job, I like it.

SUSAN ROGERS: Sounds like it would be. Do you travel almost every single day then?

DAVID LAY: I travel about four to five days a week. And I have some real, real fine managers under me in these locations.

SUSAN ROGERS: How many stores are there, about?

DAVID LAY: I have five right now.

SUSAN ROGERS: And those are what? Page-

DAVID LAY: Page, <Winslow>, <Grand Canyon>, <Cottonwood>, and <Flagstaff>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Mrs. Lay, do you want to tell me about your beauty shop?

CARMEN LAY: Oh! (laughter)

SUSAN ROGERS: Since that’s what got you back here.

CARMEN LAY: Let's see, I owned that for how many years? At that time, help was so hard to find, because you couldn't get an operator that would come to <Flagstaff> from the southern part of the state, so you always had difficulty. I can't even remember how many years I had it. Four years?

DAVID LAY: Two, three. I don't think you had it any longer than that.

CARMEN LAY: Probably wasn't more than three years, and it just got so bad that I just sold out.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Have you had any other ventures since, or anything?

CARMEN LAY: Oh, I have worked for Babbitt Brothers too.

SUSAN ROGERS: You have, huh? Okay, what have you done?

CARMEN LAY: Well, (obscured by laughter) mostly cashiering. And then at the time, they had a bakery and I used to work in the bakery. Then I would help Mr. Lay with some of the office work.

SUSAN ROGERS: Where was the bakery located?

CARMEN LAY: Well, it was in the new market, the one on Leroux.

DAVID LAY: (inaudible)

CARMEN LAY: Well, it isn't new anymore, but it was the newer market. They had a bakery. We got our bakery from Dunn's Bakery in <Williams>. They would bring it over every morning. We didn't bake it ourselves, but we sold the fresh bakery. But then I haven't worked since we had our son.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

DAVID LAY: (inaudible)

SUSAN ROGERS: To backtrack a little bit, do you remember any famous artists that came through the area? In this I mean painters, musicians, any fine performances that stick out in your mind?

CARMEN LAY: (inaudible)

DAVID LAY: (inaudible)

SUSAN ROGERS: Maybe scientists.

DAVID LAY: No, I think the ones who would impress me the most were the people at Lowell Observatory.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, tell me a little bit about them, what you remember.

DAVID LAY: Well, let's see, at the time I was growing up, most of the people in the observatory I think traded with my father. Let's see, there was V. M. Slipher, [phonetic spelling], Earl Slipher, and Mr. Tombough. And growing up, I remember these people very well. I know when we were kids; we were always using the Observatory Hill for the winter activities. They were always running out, because they plowed the road, and that was the best place in <Flagstaff> to go sledding. But the little bit that we had to see with these people, and visiting the observatory and everything, I was always interested. Very nice people. But I couldn't give you any particular details on their work.

SUSAN ROGERS: I don't think I heard enough about your father's store. Where was that one located?

DAVID LAY: It was in west <Flagstaff>, up on West Birch.

SUSAN ROGERS: So like almost to City Park, you mean?

DAVID LAY: Almost. About a block-and-a-half this side of the City Park.

SUSAN ROGERS: Is the building still there?

DAVID LAY: No, it isn't. The only house that's remaining is the one on the end of Birch. Let's see, the one on the north side would be about 824 West Birch. That would be the house that my grandfather built when they came to this country. And that was probably in the nineties. And the one right across the street would be the one that my uncle and aunt owned. And he was half-owner in the Breen-Lewis Drugstore, which is the Moore Drug. They moved down to <San Diego>. I was probably in either the sixth or seventh grade when they left <Flagstaff>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, what was your grandfather's name?

DAVID LAY: That was Rozen.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. And so was this just a little neighborhood grocery is what it was?

DAVID LAY: That's all it was. And there were two or three in the town at that time. There was one, let's see, about where the Daily Sun is at the present time - right in there. There were a couple on the south side, and there was a little one somewhere east of Babbitts', but I can't remember what the name of that was - very small store.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now did your father just run this on his own, then?

DAVID LAY: Yes, he did.

SUSAN ROGERS: And then you helped out in the store?

DAVID LAY: Probably fooled around more than I helped! (laughter)

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Any other prominent people you remember in the <Flagstaff> area growing up?

DAVID LAY: Dr. [R.O.] Raymond.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, can you tell me a little bit about him? What do you remember about seeing or anything?

DAVID LAY: Well, he was a real good friend of the family. Growing up, I remember him from the time I was born. He used to- I don't know, he just used to be a real fine fellow. I know he was out in the sheep camps a lot, because I used to go with him off and on. Let's see, the area where Lindbergh Springs is now, he donated that to the State, I believe. And the Raymond Scout Camp. Let's see, that's out south of <Parks>. I remember going there with him many times when he had the sheep out in that area, had his flocks out there. But he was one of the people, I guess, that helped more people in <Flagstaff> than anyone that I know of.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember any particular stories of maybe who he helped, or how he helped them at all?

CARMEN LAY: Oh, he helped so many.

DAVID LAY: No, not a particular story. He was the one that loaned us the money we had to build our first home. That's how close he was.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now, where did you live?

DAVID LAY: Well, let's see we owned our first home on West Cherry, 313 West Cherry.

CARMEN LAY: Right next door to Dr. Lindemann's office.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, uh-huh.

CARMEN LAY: It was a white house.

DAVID LAY: But he was the kind of a man that I never understood - I guess "at his fullest," I should say - because he was always doing the unexpected. Just a different type individual.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, any other people? People who maybe were kind of characters in the community, too, or something?

CARMEN LAY: I’m trying to think of all of these things, you can't _____.

DAVID LAY: There were a LOT of 'em, Carmen.

CARMEN LAY: Oh, I know.

DAVID LAY: Think of Pete Michelbach. I always liked him, watch him go to the mountain with his wagon. It was different. You'd see him going along with his pipe in his mouth, up the road. Joe Kellam was another one. He was for real.

SUSAN ROGERS: (inaudible, both talking at once)

DAVID LAY: He never had a nickel in his pocket, but he would always write a check, but it was always for one dollar. I can remember him doing that.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now, what did he actually do?

DAVID LAY: Well, Joe Kellam was in the cattle business. He owned a lot of the area between here and Lake Mary. And then I think they had a lot of it out north of the Babbitts' fort, I guess, out at Canyon Padré [phonetic spelling]. But he was a real character, quite interesting.

SUSAN ROGERS: What did he look like, can you tell me what he wore?

DAVID LAY: Oh, he wore Levi's, real tall Levi's. Old cowboy hat and cowboy boots. Typical westerner. Who were some of the other old-timers we had here? George Black would be a good one, out of the <Sedona> area. You always knew George Black by his hat.

CARMEN LAY: Always wore a black hat.

DAVID LAY: Well, he'd wear that old black hat, always turned down - it never was turned up. I think he wore it for fifty years. I can't remember some of the other old-timers.

SUSAN ROGERS: What about George Hochderffer.

DAVID LAY: George Hochderffer? Yes. I used to live right across the alley from him. I remember him. He used to go up to the ranch, as we called it. He had the Hochderffer Ranch up next to Mr. McVaughn [phonetic spelling, maybe McFarland] and Mrs. England. He was a real, real fine gentleman as I remember him. He didn't have a lot to say to the kids. And then we had another old-timer that lived in that neighborhood by the name of Mrs. Heiser. She was, I guess, one of the few people that was really in the cow business. I guess you'd call her a cowgirl. Everybody in the neighborhood was scared of her. She was a real character. If there was one character out of the past that you should see, that would be her - and I liked her. She wore the high black boots and a skirt. Sometimes she'd have a gun strapped on, and sometimes she wouldn't. Just a real fine person. Some of these old-timers I remember, but I don't know a lot about 'em.

SUSAN ROGERS: Right. What about Ed Whipple? Do you remember him?

DAVID LAY: No, not Ed Whipple.

SUSAN ROGERS: Can you tell me a little bit more about Mrs. England? Do you remember her at all?

DAVID LAY: Yes. She owned the house on West Santa Fe, and it's still standing, it's a red sandstone. About a block-and-a-half west of the Daily Sun. She owned that, and then she owned a ranch that would be exactly west of the present Snow Bowl. Let's see, what else can I tell you about her?

SUSAN ROGERS: There’s nothing about her character or anything?

DAVID LAY: Not too much. I saw her do one thing one time that I don't think I'd do. She was filling her car with gas - I remember that - and one of the old-timers was standing there, and he lit his pipe off of her gas tank, and I can't remember, I think it was Mr. Wetherill(?). He lived in the area of Casner Park. He was in town, and I believe it was him when he struck the match, the gas caught on fire. She used some pretty strong language, and put her hand over the cap of the gas tank, extinguishing it. (laughter) ________________.

SUSAN ROGERS: That's good.

DAVID LAY: So I think she was - I wouldn't say she had no nerve.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now, did she run a boarding house in that place?

DAVID LAY: I think she did, yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: You don't remember any particulars on that?

DAVID LAY: No, I really don't on that.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, any other families? Was Weatherford around here, or not?

DAVID LAY: Don't remember the Weatherfords. The Babbitts were all here. The Fronskes were here.

SUSAN ROGERS: You remember Dr. Fronske?

DAVID LAY: Yes! Dr. Fronske and Dr. Manning, both of 'em used to take care of me when I was a kid. I remember 'em very well. We had a scout troop, which was rather a rarity, when I was growing up. And it was Dr. Fronske and W.E.S. Thompson [phonetic spelling] that were the two gentlemen who were more or less responsible for getting anything done.

CARMEN LAY: (inaudible)

DAVID LAY: Well, in a sense, yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: I guess Dr. Fronske is still involved with the Boy Scouts.

DAVID LAY: He really is.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay any others? How about the Doyles, you remember them?

DAVID LAY: Yes, I remember 'em, I remember where they lived, but I didn't know very much about the family. As a matter of fact, they own the property where the downtown Thriftway is located.

SUSAN ROGERS: They owned it then?

DAVID LAY: They owned it at that time. But I don't remember too much about that.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, any other people offhand?

DAVID LAY: Old-timers? Probably a lot of 'em.

CARMEN LAY: (inaudible)

DAVID LAY: I knew some of 'em, but not too many. Let's see, who else still living here? (pause)

SUSAN ROGERS: How about George Jones? Did he live over in your area?

DAVID LAY: George Jones? No. No, I don't remember him. Yeah, but I can't remember any of the other old-timers. Who else do you got on your list?

SUSAN ROGERS: You got most of my names, too, on that one. I was just going to move into- Do you remember any Indians living in town at the time that you were being raised, at all?

DAVID LAY: No.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember when they first started coming in? Do you remember seeing them come in to buy supplies and stuff at all then?

DAVID LAY: Yeah, I remember 'em coming to town, but they always used to come on - most of 'em came in wagons.

[END TAPE 1, SIDE 2; BEGIN TAPE 2, SIDE 1]

DAVID LAY: They used to have that army coat with a rope wrapped around it. That's right. I remember that.

SUSAN ROGERS: That was Joe Kellam?

DAVID LAY: This was Joe Kellam. He used to come to town with the old army coat. Instead of using a belt, he used a rope. I remember that, you bet.

SUSAN ROGERS: Is his last name K-E-L-L-U-M?

DAVID LAY: No, A-M.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, I'll note that. Okay, let’s see I was asking a little bit about the Indians in those early days. Do you remember them coming in? Or do you remember when they maybe moved into town?

DAVID LAY: No, I don't remember when they moved into town. It seems to me like we've had 'em around for a long time, but I couldn't say exactly when I saw the first ones move in. I remember a lot of the old-time colored people.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay that's what I was going to ask you about next. How many families were there around that time?

DAVID LAY: Well, there were quite a few. There weren't as many maybe as we have now, but the town didn't have many people. I think we had a population in the twenties - and I might be wrong - it seems to me like it was about 2,500. In OUR area, the west end of town, we had two colored families that I can remember. But there were quite a few from the south side, some of 'em real fine people. Unbelievable.

SUSAN ROGERS: The families that lived in your neighborhood, can you tell what they did and me who they were?

DAVID LAY: Well, let's see, one was the Johnson family - that's the one I remember the best. And they had probably about six children, as I remember. But I don't remember what Mr. Johnson did. Most of these colored children went to school with us. As I remember, all of 'em that we grew up with, they were pretty nice people.

SUSAN ROGERS: You don't remember any particular problems with the blacks in <Flagstaff> at all?

DAVID LAY: Not at that time. The colored women we used to have, there was Phoebe Simon [phonetic spelling]. Phoebe Simon, Classy Simon, and some of these characters of this type - I will call them characters, because you had to call 'em by a name. If you saw a Classy, you said Classy. That's the way she wanted to be called. Phoebe, you’d call her Phoebe, and they were very polite people, it was always, "Mr. this, and Mr. that." But when it came to talking to them, they liked their, I guess, their nicknames.

SUSAN ROGERS: What did the ladies do? Were they housekeepers?

DAVID LAY: Well, let's see the one was a minister's wife. The one other lady used to do a lot of work for one of the colored charities. I don't know which one it was, for one of the churches, and she always had something she wanted to sell you - either a sweet potato pie or a chicken dinner or something of that nature. It was always good.

SUSAN ROGERS: Are any of the Johnsons left, or any of those old colored families - do you know at all?

DAVID LAY: Not that I know of, not in <Flagstaff>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Because we're trying to locate some of 'em if we could.

DAVID LAY: I think Classy was probably one of the last around, and I don't know what happened to her. But they were real, real fine people.

SUSAN ROGERS: What about Chinese? There was SOME Chinese population here, I think.

DAVID LAY: Yes, there was.

CARMEN LAY: The Wong family.

DAVID LAY: The Wong family - we used to call 'em the June family. They were probably the best-known Chinese family in <Flagstaff>. As a matter of fact, I went to school with two of the boys. And they owned the laundry at that time on the south side. Let's see who was that laundry owned by.

CARMEN LAY: Isn’t there a laundry there now?

DAVID LAY: No, it's one of George Nackard's little liquor stores, right on the corner. That's where the laundry used to be.

CARMEN LAY: Oh, yeah.

DAVID LAY: It's just a block south of Sante Fe. And the OTHER family who was prominent in this area that time was the Nackard family. We didn't even mention them.

CARMEN LAY: That's right.

DAVID LAY: And they had a little dry goods store where Joe's Place is right now, or it was next door.

CARMEN LAY: Next door, I think.

DAVID LAY: And then the other one was the Knoles family, and the Greenlaws. And that was Greenlaw out there - that was the name of that little camp.

SUSAN ROGERS: That's what you called it, huh?

DAVID LAY: That was Greenlaw. There weren't any other Chinese people, I don't believe.

CARMEN LAY: I only remember the June family.

DAVID LAY: And the Tissaws were here. The Jakles [phonetic spelling] were here. A lot of natives.

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah, those names you mentioned there, we do have them down.

DAVID LAY: I figured you would.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Let's ask you a little bit about the south side. Now as a child did you get down to South San Francisco at all? Do you remember what it was like at that time?

DAVID LAY: Speak up, Carmen.

CARMEN LAY: I don't remember, 'cause I never went around there. There couldn't have been too much there.

DAVID LAY: I don't remember THAT area too well. I remember downtown <Flagstaff> fairly well.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you want to tell me a little bit about that, then?

DAVID LAY: Well, the downtown area of <Flagstaff>, when I was growing up, like I say, there was nothing in that area where the Monte Vista was, or east of that. And Babbitts' were probably the central part of the town, and they had, in addition to the ice plant in the back, they had a packing plant. And then there was the motor company where the five-and-ten would be today (Ed: AWD building and Old Town shops). Penny’s building was where the Old packinghouse used to be. And the slaughterhouse was out east, where the Ponderosa Paper is located now. They used to kill the beef there and bring it in.

Can't remember too much about the old store, except it was the best place in <Flagstaff> to shop. I remember the feeds were all in bulk, and they had the spices in the drawers. They had the old ladders that used to run along the shelving - you'd climb up the ladder to get something down. I can remember people doing that for us. We used to buy the sugar in bulk. The brown sugar was in just big cakes.

And let's see, over on Front Street, I remember the Nackards. I remember their clothing store. The only other place there that I can remember would be known as the Bank Hotel.

SUSAN ROGERS: Camera Corral (Ed: McMillan building).

CARMEN LAY: Oh, yes, on the corner.

DAVID LAY: Right where the Camera Corral is. I remember that quite well.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now was that a hotel at that time?

DAVID LAY: Yes, it was.

CARMEN LAY: McMillans?

DAVID LAY: It was the McMillan Building, I believe.

CARMEN LAY: They were related to the Flemings some way.

DAVID LAY: That's the Fleming family.

CARMEN LAY: Fleming family, that's right.

SUSAN ROGERS: They were sheep people.

DAVID LAY: Correct.

SUSAN ROGERS: Right. Now, at the Bank Hotel, did there used to be big social events? Do you remember anything?

DAVID LAY: I can't remember that, but the place that I remember the best would be the old Elks Club. And that's just south of the Catholic Church there. That was probably one of the nicest places in <Flagstaff>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Where the library is now, you mean (Ed: Theatrikos).

DAVID LAY: Yeah. That used to be the Elks Lodge, the Elks Club. I remember that quite vividly as a youngster.

CARMEN LAY: I think that's where they held so many of their social functions, the dances, (two others talking also) because that was the largest building.

DAVID LAY: Let's see, there was the Orpheum Theater. That was the ONLY thing downtown.

SUSAN ROGERS: Well, up in high school, where did the kids used to hang out?

CARMEN LAY: The Etter family had a soda....

DAVID LAY: The Milk Depot.

CARMEN LAY: The Milk Depot, they called it. We could go in there for a dish of ice cream. And then they had a juke box, like, I guess, and we could dance in there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now, where was this located?

CARMEN LAY: What's in there now?

DAVID LAY: It's right south of Moore Drug.

CARMEN LAY: Yeah, it's right next door to the Moore Drugs. Is Carter's in there now (Ed: next to McGaugh’s)?

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah, I was thinking some clothing store, Carters, huh.

CARMEN LAY: Some clothing store in there, uh-huh. Right in there. That's where all the school kids hung out.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now, did the college kids hang out there, too, or was that mainly the high school?

CARMEN LAY: That was mainly the high school.

DAVID LAY: The high school crowd. That was the high school crowd. And then let's see, the old City Pond used to be where you used to go ice skating in the winter.

CARMEN LAY: Didn’t they have a skating rink? Where did they have that skating rink?

DAVID LAY: Well that was years later. That came in the old Elks Hall after the Elks Hall was no longer there.

CARMEN LAY: Oh! 'cause I could remember a roller skating place, and I couldn't think of where that was.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, you mean in the library building again.

CARMEN LAY: Yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: Used to be a skating rink, huh?

DAVID LAY: That used to be a skating rink.

SUSAN ROGERS: Sounds like it used to be a LOT of things. (laughs)

DAVID LAY: It's kind of in between.

SUSAN ROGERS: What about the old library? Where was that?

DAVID LAY: Okay, the old library used to be - it was torn down - it was where the Women's Club was.

SUSAN ROGERS: On Aspen, right?

DAVID LAY: On Aspen, that's right. Let's see, when we were in Emerson School and high school, we used to go down there to get books. And prior to that, it was in downtown <Flagstaff>, up above the bakery. That's where we used to have to go, was across the street from Babbitts', upstairs above Bledsoe's.

CARMEN LAY: I remember Mrs. Devaney was the librarian.

DAVID LAY: That's where the first library used to be, with Mrs. Devaney.

CARMEN LAY: Mrs. Devaney was the librarian there for years and years.

DAVID LAY: And then it moved out to west Aspen. (both talking at once)

SUSAN ROGERS: Does it seem like a lot of people used the library?

CARMEN LAY: Oh, they did THEN, seems like.

DAVID LAY: I think for the population, it was probably used more then than it is now.

SUSAN ROGERS: Really?

DAVID LAY: Well, you didn't have TV to watch, and you didn't have a radio, so you HAD to read.

CARMEN LAY: So you read a lot.

SUSAN ROGERS: Were there any kind of special summer programs for children, or anything like that?

DAVID LAY: No, very little. The scouts had Camp Geronimo out of Payson, and that was about all we had at that time.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you used to go to that camp?

DAVID LAY: No, I never did. But I can't remember much else for the children up here.

CARMEN LAY: I don’t think there was, really.

SUSAN ROGERS: How big a library WAS that? Was it the whole area above Bledsoe's?

DAVID LAY: No, it was just a couple of rooms, very small. And I can't- I used to go for Zane Grey books, mainly - that's what I used to read and quite a few on <Alaska> and _________.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you ever meet Zane Grey at all?

DAVID LAY: No.

SUSAN ROGERS: Or saw him or anything?

DAVID LAY: No.

SUSAN ROGERS: How about Andy Devine? Did you know him at all?

DAVID LAY: No, I didn't know Andy Devine.

SUSAN ROGERS: Well, you’ve just about covered all MY questions. Can you think of anything else you want to add, or any more about the buildings in the downtown area at all, or anything you can remember?

DAVID LAY: I don't really think so. There's a lot of 'em still standing - they've just been remodeled a little bit.

SUSAN ROGERS: How about when there were wooden sidewalks and the dusty streets? What was that like then?

CARMEN LAY: Well, we didn't think it was so bad THEN. (laughter) If we had to go BACK to it, it'd be pretty rough.

DAVID LAY: I think about the worst thing I can remember about that is there wasn't any snow removal in the winter. The sidewalks, as such, weren't shoveled. We were usually trying to walk the car ruts, you know, when you wanted to go anywhere. And that's about what it amounted to.

CARMEN LAY: And MUD up to you KNEES! constantly, because there WEREN'T any sidewalks.

DAVID LAY: I don’t think there is anything else that I would want to add to this.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, I'll turn it off. (tape turned off and on) Okay, you want to tell me a little bit about this area where we are right now?

DAVID LAY: Well this area right here where we live today used to be the farming area for the county poor farm, which is the Pioneer Historical Society Museum today. And about the only other building between here and the present high school would be the Pinewood Dairy, which was owned by Andy Matson, who later became one of our supervisors. I remember Andy very vividly, because he used to deliver milk to my father's store. The thing that surprised me the most was his daughters. They did most of the work for him - and I mean that those girls really worked. And other than that, there was only one other home between his place and the high school. That was probably just about where the junior high is right now, (Ed: refers to old white Jr. high school on Kendrick) and it was a white house, and they had a well in it - but I don't remember who owned it.

SUSAN ROGERS: And it's not there anymore?

DAVID LAY: Not there, it's been eradicated or erased from the area.

SUSAN ROGERS: This whole area was a field of what?

DAVID LAY: This area out here was planted in corn and potatoes. This upper area belonged to the county, and adjoined Andy Matson's property just south of here. He usually had that in corn. At that time, he had quite a few dairy cows, and he used to use it for feed.

SUSAN ROGERS: Who was working on the farms that belonged to what you called the poor farm, or on the fields?

DAVID LAY: I believe it was maintained by the residents of the poor farm.

SUSAN ROGERS: Can you tell me a little bit more about the poor farm, or what type of people were in there?

DAVID LAY: The thing that I remember most vividly is just driving by the place and seeing these individuals sitting out on the porch in the front. I just kind of hoped I'd never go with 'em.

SUSAN ROGERS: Were they usually older?

DAVID LAY: Yeah, they were old people. And let's see, I was trying to think of who took care of those. It was one of the old-timers. Mrs. Chisholm [phonetic spelling]. She was the caretaker of that. She was one of the old-timers in this area.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you ever go inside that building at that time or anything?

DAVID LAY: No, I never did. I used to cut across this field many times. But other than that, that's about as close as I got to it.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. (tape turned off and on)

CARMEN LAY: He whispered it in my ear.

DAVID LAY: Mr. Logan! was one of the old-timers. And he used to go out and bring lion and bear in alive. He had a pack of hounds, and he made several movies. I believe they'd be back in the late twenties or early thirties. And most of his filming was done in the Foxboro area, along the rim of <Oak Creek> there. He used to bring 'em in, in the back of a stake-body pickup. I can still see 'em, their paws chained together. He lived about a block-and-a-half down the street from us, and he used to turn the bear loose and let 'em run up the alley. Then he'd tree 'em in the park just for exercise.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now, why would he bring them in alive? What was the reason?

DAVID LAY: He sold these. I don't know who he sold 'em to - I think it was some of the zoos. I think he had a few contracts with some of the circuses in the area.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Do you want to go ahead and put on tape about Dr. Raymond, and what he wore and his talking habit.

DAVID LAY: Dr. Raymond was a rather tall gentleman. I would say he was six-feet-two, or in that area. Usually always dressed in gray, it was a gray suit - very dignified. In the later years he always had a cane. He had a gold watch chain that was always across his tie when he wore a tie. And if he was talking to you, sometimes he'd just cut the conversation off rather abruptly. And then the next time, he'd spend all day with you. Let's see, what were some of his likes? He had some little peculiarities, I guess. But I remember, whenever you had any wild game - I remember this very distinctly - he always wanted the liver, nothing else. He liked his fruit, and I guess he was one of the first gentlemen I ever remember in <Flagstaff> that had a compost pile. Organic gardening was a very strong hobby of his, I would say. He always had this. He would tell you how to make anything grow, whether it would do it or not. I can't remember a lot more about him.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now, where did he have this garden?

DAVID LAY: Well, he used to have a little garden right behind his office there, where Jean and Trox are located today.

SUSAN ROGERS: Back in the alley you mean or something?

DAVID LAY: Right back in the alley. Right behind his office there was a little area in there, he used to have a garden. He enjoyed getting out and seeing what was happening, and I know many times he'd come around to see what your garden was doing, or how your flowers were growing, and then you would have a nice lecture on organic gardening. But he had a good compost pile, believe me.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Is there anything else while we're still running?

DAVID LAY: I don’t think so. (tape turned off and on) All right. Going back to Mrs. England and Pete Michelbach. The little bit I remember about 'em is that they had their farms up in the area of the Snow Bowl, and they were quite well-known for the type of potatoes they raised. They seemed to take a lot of pride in their product. And it WAS good, it was one of the potatoes in this area that did well. And in the old days when you were cooking on a wood stove, it seemed like the people were more conscious of how long it took to boil a potato, and these seemed to boil up rather rapidly. So they were quite proud of this potato. I remember that much of 'em.

SUSAN ROGERS: Were potatoes shipped out of the area, too, or were they just local?

DAVID LAY: No, most of those were local.

SUSAN ROGERS: So nobody was in the potato ___, shipping them out?

DAVID LAY: No. About the only thing that I think they shipped out of this area was probably the pinto beans. They raised a LOT of pinto beans. And that was all east.

SUSAN ROGERS: I wonder why those things aren't raised anymore in the area.

DAVID LAY: Well, I say two reasons: during the war it was a soil bank, they didn't want the people to raise their crops. We had a surplus right after the war. And then the other thing is the development of the housing in the area. Most of these areas now, are developed into subdivisions.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Can you think of any other people that I haven't put down on my master list as far as interviewing? We've gone through quite a few names that I wrote down as we went along.

DAVID LAY: I’d get, if I were you, if you don't have him, I'd get Ted Babbitt.

SUSAN ROGERS: Ted Babbit, okay.

DAVID LAY: I'd get Mary Bilby.

SUSAN ROGERS: Mary who?

DAVID LAY: Bilby. Now, both of those people are natives to this area.

SUSAN ROGERS: Is that B-I-L?

DAVID LAY: B-Y. Mary Bilby would be from the Joe Babbitt family. She would have a lot of history going back into her father and his activities. And I guess he has probably the best collection maybe of Indian artifacts in this area. I know she has a lot on his background. And Ted could give you in-depth a lot of the <Flagstaff>, Northern <Arizona>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

DAVID LAY: Ted's father was Ray Babbitt. His grandfather was Dave Babbitt of the original Babbitt Brothers. So he could give you in-depth. Now, if you want to get into the cattle, I would see John Babbitt.

SUSAN ROGERS: I’ve had an interview with John.

DAVID LAY: Have you?

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah. How about any old sheep people?

DAVID LAY: Try to get Frank Auza. He's probably got as many sheep as anybody right now.

SUSAN ROGERS: Is that Auza [spelling name, but I can't understand her, due to the poor quality tape (Tr.)].

DAVID LAY: A-U-Z-A.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. We’er having trouble getting a hold of him apparently he’s on a sheep drive or something. A-Z....

DAVID LAY: A-U-Z-A.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, we have tried to contact him. I didn’t recognize the name when you said it.

DAVID LAY: I think you have his telephone number. I do. He just called me the other morning.

SUSAN ROGERS: Really?

CARMEN LAY: He was here just for a couple of days.

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah, because Henry Glicas was helping us locate him and we got his wife.

DAVID LAY: He was a very, very good friend of Dr. Raymond's.

SUSAN ROGERS: He was, huh?

CARMEN LAY: He could probably tell you a lot about Dr. Raymond.

DAVID LAY: He could tell you MORE about Dr. Raymond, probably, than anybody living today - unless it would be Dr. Fronske.

SUSAN ROGERS: Right.

DAVID LAY: And I know Frank could tell you a lot of little sidelights.

SUSAN ROGERS: That’s too bad. I didn’t know you knew him, we could have it combined, two, at the same time. Helps everybody's memory sometimes.

CARMEN LAY: Didn't even think of him.

DAVID LAY: I think the Auzos are the oldest sheep people, because the Charlebois are out of it. Lou's passed away, but he sold prior to that. The Espils haven't been in it, I mean the _______ Espils.

CARMEN LAY: Now the Locketts have, but then they don't live here.

DAVID LAY: No they switched from some sheep to, oh-

CARMEN LAY: Now they're in cattle, rather than sheep.

SUSAN ROGERS: They usually go to <Phoenix> during the winter.

DAVID LAY: See, Frank Auza could tell you about Dr. Raymond and Ramon Asowhen(?) he had sheep. Ramon is no longer with us. But he could give you all of the old-time sheep people, all the way back to the Pollocks.

CARMEN LAY: That's right, he sure could. If you want to know about sheep, he'd be the one to tell you.

DAVID LAY: He surely would. But I don't know of anybody else in the sheep.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, or any at all.

CARMEN LAY: Frank will be up here for the summer, though, again.

DAVID LAY: Oh, he's up about every two, three weeks.

CARMEN LAY: She’s here; you said you got in touch with-

SUSAN ROGERS: Henry Glicas called her, and tried to work out. Now, this is way last November and it didn’t seem possible at the time. He's only in here for a couple of days, I think, at a time, or something. He didn't feel like he could do it then.

CARMEN LAY: But I think he's here most of the summer.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. You mentioned - I just saw a little note - the Spruce Cabin. Seems to me somebody came and asked for information in the library the other day.

DAVID LAY: Okay, it's right at the top of the old ski tow - not the one that goes all the way up. It's right at the top of the short run, where you would get off the tow there, it's just about a hundred yards up the hill in the timber there, still standing.

SUSAN ROGERS: What was that originally? Was it someone's private place?

DAVID LAY: I don't know exactly what that was, but that's where we used to go a lot, up to Spruce Cabin. There was nobody living there at that time. And whether it was something one of the pioneers put in, or the Forest Service, I don't know.

SUSAN ROGERS: Well, can you think of anything else. You can keep going on and on which is great. That's good.

CARMEN LAY: Keep thinking of somebody else. 

GEORGE: When did Kramer come into this country? (inaudible, far away)

DAVID LAY: I don't know when Mr. Kramer came, George.

SUSAN ROGERS: Cliff Kramer? I've had an interview with him.

DAVID LAY: Dr. Lindemann’s [phonetic spelling] a good one.

SUSAN ROGERS: Got him last week.

DAVID LAY: There's a lot of 'em here that are native sons. He was one. And like I say, Ted Babbitt is another one. Mary Bilby is another, a native daughter. These people can give you a lot of history. Carter Jakle isn't here anymore.

CARMEN LAY: (inaudible)

DAVID LAY: So many of 'em that have passed away in the last four or five years. They're just not here anymore.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay why don’t I go ahead and turn this off. (tape turned off and on)

DAVID LAY: I remember a few things from my father, and one of 'em was when the road was put down <Oak Creek Canyon> - I guess the original road. There were a lot of sharp switchbacks on it. The old Model "T's" that they had at that time, I remember they had to have a [ruxle?] axle. Seemed to give 'em a little more power or something. But in addition to this, they never had any brakes. And he used to tell me when he used to go down the old Oak Creek Hill into the canyon, he used to tie a log behind his Model "T" to keep it from going so fast. That was a long ways back.
