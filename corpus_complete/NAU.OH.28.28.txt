This is an interview with Mary Prochnow Lewis who is a <Flagstaff> native. This interview is being conducted on January 6, 1976, at 115 E. Terrace Avenue, #9, which is her apartment. The interviewer is Susan L. Rogers, representing the Flagstaff City-Coconino County Public Library. 



SUSAN L. ROGERS: Mrs. Lewis, when and where were you born? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: In <Flagstaff>, August 1, 1902. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Can you tell me a little bit about your parents and their background? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Well, my father was born in <Berlin Germany>. My mother was born in Alsace-Lorraine. She came to this country to keep house for her brother who was living in  <Albuquerque New Mexico>. And then she moved here and was living with some brothers. My father was on his way to <Alaska> to make a fortune. He arrived in <Flagstaff> and was broke and was lookin' for a job, and he saw in the local paper where they needed a mechanic at the Arizona Lumber and Timber Company. He applied for the job and he got it, and met my mother, and they were married here in 1899. 



SUSAN ROGERS: What was your mother's full name before she got married? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Her maiden name was Elizabeth Burrus, B U R R U S. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. What was your father's first name? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Charles. 



SUSAN ROGERS: They got married in 1899. Where did they live when they first got married, do you know? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Yes, but the company, the Arizona Lumber and Timber Company, had a house up there near the mill, and they lived there. And the present Big Bob Restaurant is where the house was, and I was born in that house. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Now, was this a house for employees, or did just your parents live there? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: No, it was for the employees, but they rented it from the company. 



SUSAN ROGERS: I see. And you were born in that house. Tell me a little bit about your father's job. Did he used to ever tell you about working at the sawmill? How long did he work there? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: He was a mechanic - kind of like engineer and that - in the mill. I can't remember how long he worked there, but then he was offered a better job at the Flagstaff Lumber Company, which is now the Southwest Lumber Mill. And so we moved there. We lived in four little houses one winter, and it was BITTER cold, while we were waiting for our home to be built. 



SUSAN ROGERS: What year was this, about? Just general. 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: (pause) Probably 1912, 1914 or '15, somewhere in there. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, again these were company houses that you were living in? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: These little houses were company houses, but we lived right there until - and our home was built there. It's over there now, by the Southwest Lumber Company. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Tell me exactly where that house is. I think I know, but.... 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Well they had a picture of it. It's on South Elden, and they ran a picture and a story about it. Some man was writing about the older houses here in town. I can't remember his name now, but he wrote a story about the house, and that I could look out my window and see it. That was when I lived in Apartment #17, I lived on the back, and I could look out the terrace and see the old home place. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Can you tell me a little about the house, even though you said it was in the article. Why don't you go ahead and tell me a little bit about it? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: You mean the one my father had built? 



SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah. 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: It was a nice big house. You know, I'm one of twelve children. We all managed. We had five bedrooms and just one bathroom that's larger now than a lot of people's living rooms. We had a big kitchen with a wood stove in it, and wood boxes built around each side. We spent many happy hours in that kitchen playing cards and making fudge and telling stories. We had a big vacant lot on the outside there, and we had our own ball team. (laughter) 



SUSAN ROGERS: Twelve children! You want to run through them and tell me a little bit about each one. 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Well, the oldest brother is now retired and lives in <Sun City>. His name is Ray. Then I was next, and then the next one was a brother, and he died in Winslow in 1946. And then the next one was a sister, Cecelia Waterhouse, who we visited in <Washington DC> during the month of November, and then she came out here and is just returning home today! 



SUSAN ROGERS: My goodness! 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Then there's Charlie. He lives on the coast now and works with my brother Dick. And then my brother Bob lives in Montezuma, and he's a retired former state senator for <Coconino County>. He had a splendid record while he worked for the county and the legislature - was very well thought of. Then the next brother, Dick, lives on the coast with Charlie. George is the next brother and has just recently retired from managing the Ramada here in <Flagstaff>. And then the girls, the oldest sister of the four - a boy and a girl were first born, and then there were four boys, and then four girls. So the oldest of the four girls lives in <Camp Verde>, she works for the Forest Service, Martha Butler. The next one, Catherine, is an R.N. in <Sun City>, living with her husband who's a retired Air Force colonel. 



SUSAN ROGERS: And what's her name? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Catherine Keely [phonetic spelling]. And then Betty Biller lives here in town. Her husband's in the insurance business. And then Eleanor Durkee. She lost her husband here this past March. She has a son in.... Well, her middle boy was drowned at Lake Ashurst five years ago, duck hunting. Her youngest son lives here with her, and her oldest son works in a restaurant up in <Vail>. And they were up in <Vail> spending Christmas with him. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, now, where did you go to school? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: The Flagstaff schools here. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, did you go to Emerson? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: No, no the Catholic schools. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, you went to Catholic school! Okay, do you want to tell me a little bit about that? We haven’t heard much about that. 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Well, the sisters, you know. Not much to say. 



SUSAN ROGERS: What was the building at that time? What was it like? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: It's been torn down, and it was where the new hall is, you know, their.... Well, it's on the front. The school was on the rear, and this is in the front here. It was right on that street there. That's the Cherry- I believe, uh-huh. Yes, we had a grotto on the inside, it was all enclosed. It was a lovely place. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, and so about how many kids went there. 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Oh, I can't really remember. It was quite a few. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Did you used to have any rivalry with the public schools? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: No. 



SUSAN ROGERS: I mean, maybe in sports even or something like that? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: No. We didn't do too much those days. You know we didn't have as much as they have now. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. And did you used to walk to school? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Yes, WAY over there by the Southwest Lumber Company. Way over there. And we'd walk home for lunch. Mama always had a hot meal ready for us when we got there. 



SUSAN ROGERS: And then you had to walk back? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: We didn't have a car until we were pretty well grown. 



SUSAN ROGERS: What did your family do on a day-to-day basis in the summertime when there was no school going on? Did you have special chores you had to do? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: We all had our chores to do. We had a cow for a long time - our own cow over there. But my mama always had things for us to do, and we all had to help with the house. You know, with twelve children.... And the boys would bring in the wood or go out and get wood. We always had to help. Mama taught the girls how to bake and cook. 



SUSAN ROGERS: You said something about a cow. Does that mean that you peddled milk then? That your family sold the milk to the neighborhood? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: No, no. 



SUSAN ROGERS: It was just for your own family? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: For our own family. Mama made cottage cheese and all those things with it, you know. 



SUSAN ROGERS: But she didn't sell it or anything? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: No. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Tell me a little bit about your neighborhood over there at that time. What houses were up around you? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: There weren't VERY many neighbors there, and they were all Spanish-speaking people there. And we got along well with the children, never had any problems at all. It's still some pretty good houses on that street, and there are some nice folks living there. And then when we sold the big house, it was the first GI loan in <Coconino County>. The Mexican man that bought it, his son got a GI loan for them. Of course as they all grew up and moved away and had their own homes, I was the only one left at home then, and we sold the house and I moved down here to 316 East Birch. And my mother only lived about a month after we moved. She had cancer and she had been very ill for two years. My father and I lived there ten years, and then I built the house on the corner here on Birch. Well, they still call this Birch, too, around the corner. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Birch and what? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Birch and Terrace, I believe. Right down there at the corner. My father passed away in '61. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Did he work for the lumber mill the whole time? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: My father? 



SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah. 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: He did up until 1920, I believe, and then he leased the Commercial Hotel from Babbitts. 



SUSAN ROGERS: And how long did he run that? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Until 1930. We lost it during the Depression. Business was SO bad. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Since you brought up the Depression, let's move into that a little bit. Can you tell me how it affected your family? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Well, we all went to work. We managed. We stayed off of relief that’s for sure. We all went to work and the boys pitched in and helped. I helped my father at the hotel until after the Depression. Then shortly after that, I got married. Then I was divorced from my husband in '36. He was a state game warden. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Can you describe the Commercial Hotel to me then? What was it like? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Well, in those days, it was considered the best hotel in town until they built the Monte Vista. And the Monte Vista really did hurt us because all the local merchants had stock in the hotel and salesmen that came by, if they didn't stay there, why, they wouldn't buy from 'em. So it really hurt our business pretty bad. We had thirty-two rooms, had a real nice lobby. 



SUSAN ROGERS: What kind of furniture was in the lobby? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Nice oak furniture with leather seats. 



SUSAN ROGERS: What did you do when you worked there? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: I worked at the desk with my father. 



SUSAN ROGERS: In those early days when you were a kid, did you used to come downtown quite a bit since you lived far away, or did you.... 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Not too much, except on Sundays to go to the show, or matinee. 



SUSAN ROGERS: And where was the matinee at that time? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Up where the Orpheum Theater is now. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Where did your father do most of his shopping? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: At Babbitts', because we didn't have Safeways and things like that. Babbitts' was really the only.... And then there were little markets around, but Babbitts' was the big market. 



SUSAN ROGERS: What do you remember about some of those early Fourth of Julys? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Oh, they were great! The Elks used to put them on, you know, and they really were great. 



SUSAN ROGERS: What went on, what did you do? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Oh, I don't know, they had different things for the children to play different games: a gunny sack race, and I don't know, I can't remember all of them now. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Were there fireworks? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Oh, yes. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember any special Christmases? How did your family celebrate Christmas? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Well, we were always together. You know, we had our tree and Santa Claus came to see us. It was a family gathering for years. As we grew up and got married, most of 'em lived around here. We always had Thanksgiving and Christmas in our home. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Did you chop down your own tree? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Oh, yes! We walked out on the highway where.... What's that hotel there where you cross the tracks? (pause) Well, that seemed like a long ways out. We went there to get our Christmas tree. 



SUSAN ROGERS: You mean like the Butler interchange, in there somewhere? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Uh-huh, and the Santa Fe and then Butler. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: I’ve forgotten the name of it. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Did everybody pretty much go out and cut their own tree? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Well, the family was there and we always cut our own tree for the family, if that's what you mean. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember the flu epidemic? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: We survived it, all of us. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Did you have neighbors that died, or do you remember any particular episodes from that? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: No. Different people here in town, but not really any of the neighbors. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, so it didn't really affect you personally. 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: No, it didn't. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember the Prohibition days in <Flagstaff>? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: (laughs) I remember some of it, how they would catch different bootleggers, you know. There was always a story in the paper about somebody makin' home brew somewhere. I just remember a little bit about it. 



SUSAN ROGERS: You don't remember any particular incidents? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: No. No, I don't. 



SUSAN ROGERS: How did World War I affect <Flagstaff>? What did you do at that time? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Well, I was pretty young. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember when the war was over, the celebration? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Yeah. 



SUSAN ROGERS: What was that like? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Oh, of course there were a lot of.... What do I want to say? You know, people celebrating and had parades and a lot of excitement and fireworks that it WAS over. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, what about World War II? What did <Flagstaff> do then? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Well that’s a funny story. I had been in <Phoenix> with three of my sisters and we were coming back and we stopped in Sedona to get a cold drink or something, and one of the younger sisters came running out, and she said, "Oh, the Japs have bombed <Pearl Harbor>!" Oh, she was so excited! And I said, "Oh, no, you must have heard something wrong." "No," she said, "everybody's excited, and there's a lot of talk about it." So we waited 'til we got home, and of course my father couldn't wait to tell us about it, you know. Everybody was quite excited about it. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Were there any special celebrations when THAT was over? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Well, not too much that I can really remember. I'm sure there was, you know - everybody was happy. (dog barks) 



SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember any big fires happening in <Flagstaff>? Do you remember anything in particular? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: (pause) There were some, but I can't recall any right now. 



SUSAN ROGERS: What about either floods or blizzards? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: We had some pretty bad winters, you know. Some winters were really bad. When we used to go to school, I know that it would start storming before Thanksgiving, and it just seemed it stormed right through 'til Easter time. It was some pretty cold weather there. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember any particular crimes happening that when you were a child that you remember? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Well, there was right there where.... What is that motel in a uh? Just around the bend there was a family called the Azbil [phonetic spelling] boys, and they murdered. There was quite a murder there. The two brothers were involved. I think they got the death sentence, but that was a lot of publicity over that. I was quite young. I don't remember too much about it. But, no. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Let's go back to some of your schooling. After you finished at the Catholic school, where did you go then? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Up at the Normal School for a couple of years. 



SUSAN ROGERS: And you were going to high school there, right? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Yeah, they had the high school there. 



SUSAN ROGERS: And again you walked? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Yes. 



SUSAN ROGERS: What kind of social activities did you do outside of the classroom up there? Anything special? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: No. No, we weren't very athletic in those days - had too much to do at home. 



SUSAN ROGERS: You always had to come home and do your chores. 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Yes. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember any social events? Were there a lot of dances or anything like that? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Well, the American Legion always had a dance. Oh maybe the "Knights of Columbus," or some of them. I don't remember any special things. Of course always election time there were a lot of dances given, you know. 



SUSAN ROGERS: In what building were the dances given in? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: There was one upstairs there up over where Nelo Rhoton’s office is now downtown. The second building over. There were some dances upstairs in that building. I didn't go socially as much as Louise and Mary and her sister and they, they were with a crowd that they always had something going, you know. That group. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Your family owned the Commercial Hotel. Did you notice a lot of tourists coming in? Like, where did most of the tourists come from, what area? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: From the East going to <California>. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Really, just like now? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: I remember there was a shooting there. We had a gas tank out in front of the hotel, and we sold tickets for the Greyhound, and they would gas their car there. And then a man by the name of Thomas was.... There was a shooting. He was after somebody; I don't know what they did. My father was working that night, we didn't have a night clerk, and I remember the story, and this man shot Mr. Thomas, didn't kill him, and then Mr. Thomas was always pretty badly crippled after that. That happened while we were still at the hotel. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Was the hotel usually full every night, just about? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Well, before we had competition, we sure did. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Every single night, most of people...? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: There were tourists and salesmen. A lot of salesmen came in. You don't see all those salesmen now. You know, they don't.... I mean, the Weatherford Hotel would take the overflow, and the two hotels did real well. 



SUSAN ROGERS: What about the Bank Hotel? Was that in operation? The Bank Hotel you know where Camera Corral is? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Yeah, they just had a few rooms upstairs, you know the family living in there. 



SUSAN ROGERS: They didn't have too much? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: No they didn't have very much. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Did most of these people come off of the train, or were they driving? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Well, most of the tourists were driving, but the salesmen used the trains a lot. Because we had a little old man staying there that when the salesmen came in, they had their tickets and he would go down and get their samples and bring them up and show 'em in the sample room. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, when you were young, did you used to ever take any trips, like to <Oak Creek>? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Oh yeah, we went there a lot. We went to Lake Mary, fishing. And I remember my brothers telling about when Mr. Vandivier, who was formally sheriff, was running, was engineer on the train that went out to the logging camps to get logs. He would let the boys ride with him in the morning to Lake Mary. He'd let 'em off, and then when he was coming home, he'd toot WAY down.... The boys were laughing about this the other day. He'd toot so they'd come on up and be ready to come back with him. That was a lot of sport for us, and not having a car, unless somebody took us.... We'd go there, and we'd go to <Oak Creek>. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Did you make any trips up to the <Grand Canyon>? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: No. I was a pretty big girl before I got to the <Grand Canyon>. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, and what about the tourists at the Commercial Hotel, did a lot of them used to go up to see the <Grand Canyon>, or did they just go on to <California>? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Well, I think they did. I think most of them would go to the Canyon. 



SUSAN ROGERS: How would they get up there? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: They had their own cars. And then there was a train running from <Williams> to the <Grand Canyon>. And I think they went on buses that far, or their own car. You see that train was running to the Canyon nearly every day, and they had a lot of people going. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Did you ever go anywhere on the train? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Yes, I went to - when my mother was over on the coast one summer, we went over on the train and spent the summer down at Ocean Park. 



SUSAN ROGERS: What was that train ride like? Was it real nice? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Yeah. We were in the chair car. The trains were so crowded we didn't get a Pullman. I remember when my mother went over - we didn't go with her, we went later - she had a drawing room, because there were several little ones, you know. And then we came back with her, we thought that was great! That drawing room was great! And of course they stopped at the Harvey Houses to eat, you know, and that was really something. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Now, explain what the Harvey House was. 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Well, that's where you went in, that was the Needle’s stop. And they served EXCELLENT food. 



SUSAN ROGERS: And how often would they be along the tracks? Like where was the closest one.... 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Well, <Williams> and <Ash Fork>. And then I believe the next Harvey House was <Needles>. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Did you used to ever go out to <Walnut Canyon>? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Not too often, because we didn't have a car, unless we went with somebody. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Did any of your friends have cars, so that you were able to go with them? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Yeah. And when we got a little bit older, we finally had a car. But taking care of so many children in those days, a big family, you know. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Right that’s a lot. Did your brothers used to go hunting at all? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Yes, the boys went deer hunting. Not a whole lot. Not any of them are really.... I'm really surprised, there's six boys - only one brother, the brother that lived in Winslow, when he was there he was always hunting. He'd go out and get his elk and his deer. But the other boys didn't do very much hunting. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Did you ever used to get out to the San Francisco Peaks? (no audible response) Never? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: No. I didn't go up there until they built the road for the ski bowl. It wasn't much of a road there. 



SUSAN ROGERS: When was that? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: I can't remember. Then we used to go quite often after they had that. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Did you used to go when they had that Weatherford Road where you had to pay? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: No, I never did go on that Weatherford Road, no. 



SUSAN ROGERS: I have down here, were you the treasurer? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: No, Clerk of the Court. I was elected in 1939 and I served twenty-eight years. 



SUSAN ROGERS: My goodness! We have to hear a little bit about that. Let me turn the tape over. 



[END TAPE 1, SIDE 1, BEGIN TAPE 1, SIDE 2] 



SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, do you want to tell me.... 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Well, it was quite an experience for me, because I was divorced then and I worked one year in the welfare office when this job was coming up for election. The widow of the former clerk was quite elderly, and the Board of Supervisors had appointed her, Mrs. Rees [phonetic spelling]. And of course she was up in her eighties then. And so I ran against her. Well, I had three opponents and I was high man out of the three. I had my office for twenty-eight years. I had some broader experience, different trial and criminal case, you know (dog barks). It was quite an experience, and having been raised here, I helped a LOT of people get their citizenship papers, because these people knew me, and they didn't know how to go about it. And I would write letters for them personally. And when the welfare used to help these elderly people, it was a county deal. And then they turned it over to the state and federal. Well, these people had to prove their citizenship, and a lot of them had no records of their birth. And it was quite a job to go back and find out some of 'em, oh.... Well, they had children, and on their children's birth certificate would give the mother and father's birth dates. And some of them had insurance records or lodge records, but it took a lot of work to get proof for some of these people. And I was happy to do it, because I made a lot of friends doing it. 



SUSAN ROGERS: What other things did your job consist of that you had to do? What other things did you have to do in your job? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Oh, well, we had, well the court records, you know, for Superior Court, and marriage licenses, and drawing juries for different jury terms. We kept pretty busy. But it's really interesting, when I took the office in January 1939; it paid $200 a month. It's paying over $900 a month now. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Wish you still had it, huh? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: I had one deputy for a long, long time, and that was Mrs. Beamer. She was excellent. 



SUSAN ROGERS: I didn't know that. 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Oh, she was excellent. Then I was defeated in.... I didn't want to run. I was talked into it by some of the attorneys, so I didn't make any efforts to try to get it, and I was only beat by 127 votes. It was a relief; it really was, after twenty-eight years. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah. Who were some of the prominent attorneys at that time when you first started working? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Well, the late C.B. Wilson and Mr. Gold. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Can you describe them, tell a little bit about them? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Oh, Mr. Wilson was a great person. He was a BIG help to me in many, many ways, because it was all new to me. But Mrs. Beamer had worked for him, so she had legal experience and she was excellent. She and Mr. Wilson taught ME what I knew. And then Mr. Gold was nice to work with. I can't remember some of the others. Karl Mangum came in shortly after that as county attorney. And now they have so many of 'em I don't know all of 'em. 



SUSAN ROGERS: (chuckles) Right. Just in case I don't get down to interview your brother who was senator, can I ask you a little bit more about him? He's on our list to interview. 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: You have him? 



SUSAN ROGERS: I have him on our list, but I'm not sure if I'm going to get down there. 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: He lives down at <Lake Montezuma>. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Right, so I don't know if I'm going to be able to make a trip down there. 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Well, he got the Forestry School. He worked on that and was able to put it through the legislature for the college. He deserves a lot of credit for that. He did an excellent job. People who know him know he really did an outstanding job for <Coconino County>. 



SUSAN ROGERS: When was he senator, and how did he decide to run, do you remember? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: No, I don't. 



SUSAN ROGERS: About how many years was he senator? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Twelve years. 



SUSAN ROGERS: But you don't remember what his reasons were. Was he a lawyer before, or what? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: No, he was a businessman. He was in the insurance business and he had that McGaugh’s Newsstand, then he sold it. Then he was in the insurance business. He could give you quite a story on some of the things for <Coconino County> if you could get down there. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah that sounds good. When you were working at the Commercial Hotel your family had, do you remember any particularly famous people coming through? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Oh, yes, we had William Boyd and we had Richard Dix and Noah Barry. And oh, I don't know how many of 'em used to come and stay there. And then Zane Grey wouldn't stay anywhere but there. He was VERY fond of my father. And then when Governor Hunt would come to <Flagstaff>, he always stayed with my father. I know one time when he came, the Monte Vista Hotel was built, and he said, "I'm not ABOUT to stay there! I want to stay with my friend Charlie!" And he did. 



SUSAN ROGERS: What do you remember about Zane Grey? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Not too much. He was out a lot. Just meeting him in and out. He would visit with my father. 



SUSAN ROGERS: And some of those other people you mentioned. I don't know if I know exactly who they were. Can you tell me a little bit about them? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Oh, you mean the movie people? 



SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah. 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: They would go out in the morning and then come back at night. You know you didn't have much contact with them, but they were pleasant. We used to have a dining room connected there to the hotel, but we just couldn't keep help in there - cooks and waitresses and that - but they brought their own cook and waitress, and they used the dining room, prepared their meals in there for their company. 



SUSAN ROGERS: So they were here filming? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Uh-huh. 



SUSAN ROGERS: How long did they stay, about? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Two or three weeks maybe. 



SUSAN ROGERS: And they'd just bring everything in? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Uh-huh. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember any of the movies that were filmed? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: No, I can't remember any of them. 



SUSAN ROGERS: How about, do you remember any famous painters or scientists in the area that came through? (no audible response) Did you sell tourist items in the hotel at all, any kind of Indian arts and crafts? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: No. No, they didn't have anything like that then. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Along Santa Fe, were there a lot of Indian stores at that time, selling things? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: No. The only thing I remember is maybe Babbitts' had a little bit, they, they'd go on the reservation and get their stuff, or they'd buy it at the <Grand Canyon>. It was not handled here in town. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. When do you think that started, when they started selling the Indian things? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Not too far back. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Not too long ago, huh? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Yeah, those stores haven't been here too long - maybe ten or twelve years, if THAT long. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Really? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Uh-huh. 



SUSAN ROGERS: What stores were right around the Commercial Hotel when you owned it? What types of stores and who owned them? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Well, there were restaurants. There was the El Patio Café and then there was a Chinese restaurant the other way. And then you go up the corner with the drugstore. I don't know what's on the corner there now, on the corner of Leroux and Santa Fe. It's some kind of an arts and crafts, isn't it? 



SUSAN ROGERS: Uh-huh. 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Well that was a nice drugstore. 



SUSAN ROGERS: You mentioned the Chinese. Were there quite a few Chinese in town, or not? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Not too many, no. In fact, there are not too many here now. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. And most the Chinese that lived here did run the restaurant? Did you know any personally? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: No. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Even though they ran that restaurant? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: No, I didn't know them very well. I don't think the ones on the west side - they weren't here very long, and then the El Patio was [owned] by a Greek __________. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Were there any Indians living in town then? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: No. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Did you used to ever go out to the reservation as a child? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: I went with some friends to <Tuba City>. And then I went to the Snake Dance at Moenkopi. My brother was living at <Winslow> then, and I went with him. We got caught in between two washes. We were really frightened coming back, because they just come up, they come out of nowhere. Luckily we were caught just between two, so we didn't get caught in the middle. I went to <Tuba City> several times, and <Moenkopi> - you know, that Hopi village out of <Tuba City>. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Can you tell me about the Snake Dance? What was it like? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Well, we got there and parked the car and walked up and we sat up on top of these buildings and just watched 'em comin' out of those kivas with their snakes. They weren't very happy about having white people come, you know. Finally they got to where not very many people recently - I don't think they allow many of 'em in certain areas. It was hot. 



SUSAN ROGERS: About what year was it when you went? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Really, I don't remember. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Was it the forties? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: Probably. 



SUSAN ROGERS: About how many white people were there at that time? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: There were quite a few that came from <Winslow> and here. A lot of them came camped out you know, to get there. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Were there a lot of tourists there from back East, or not? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: No, I don't think so. They didn't hear much about that then. And in fact, I don't think they have too many tourists NOW. 



SUSAN ROGERS: I don't know. Okay, you've answered pretty much all my questions. Can you think of anything else you want to add? Any funny experiences you remember as a child? Or any family gatherings or anything? 



MARY PROCHNOW LEWIS: No, just that we always had such nice family gatherings. I know we were always a very close family and we were always together and always taking up for each other. No, I can't really. We did have a happy childhood, because among ourselves we had enough entertainment. My father and mother were good to us and we were just happy to be a family. 



SUSAN ROGERS: Okay that’s fine.
