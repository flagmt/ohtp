MARIA MARCILLA: There's a lot of people that died from this. Only quite a few people left, you know, from the old times, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, when you lived here at Old Town Springs, and then did you move somewhere else in <Flagstaff>, or is that when you moved to town?

MRS. FRIAS: Yes, uh-huh, over there.

SUSAN ROGERS: And those are the two main places you've lived?

MRS. FRIAS: Uh-huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Where did you go to school then?

MARIA MARCILLA: I went to - first I used to have in training school in NAU. Another school of the university school. And we used to have training in school there, in the first building, entering university. And then they changed us to South Beaver, when they opened up Beaver, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: South  Beaver?

MARIA MARCILLA: South  Beaver here.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, the school, that's where you went?

MARIA MARCILLA: Uh-huh, South  Beaver. They built it in those years.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, can you describe the neighborhood for me when you lived there? What did you do as a kid?

MARIA MARCILLA: Well, they just played around like in the snow, and, you know. And then, well, they had more activities I think when we were small in those days than the children have now.

SUSAN ROGERS: Like what?

MARIA MARCILLA: Well, because, we used to celebrate like Halloween, a lot, you know. Doing a lot of stuff, you know, like playing around more than we do here now. You know, like now they just break windows and other.... But in those old days, they had different things, you know. Children were more, you know....

SUSAN ROGERS: Did Mr. Dolan have Halloween parties too?

MARIA MARCILLA: Yes, they did have a lot of Halloween parties. And I always used to go trick-or-treat. And then they used to have an old saint over there. It was the Sacred Heart of Jesus. In the old house over there. They used to have a saint over there, you know, for the people, just like in a statue. And now they transfer into the cemetery. It's right there, you know. It's been in all the statue there. And it's in the Calvary Cemetery now. Have you seen it?

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh-huh. Yes.

MARIA MARCILLA: Then after that, I am moved to <Mexico>, and I lived in <Mexico> for seven years. And then when we came back, after my dad died in 1942 in <Mexico>, and we came back in 1950. And we went back, because the town was already over there when Mr. Dolan was having the houses removed - it was already disappearing. When I came, there was only a few people living there. We to visit some of the neighbors, you know, that we lived, when we went to <Mexico>, and there were just only a few people that were living there. And I remember that they had no running water, you know, in the houses or anything. They had no facilities at all, you know, like the original they had it outside and all that. But we came back and then we used to live here in Mr. Vasquez' property. It was some of the Mexicans.

SUSAN ROGERS: Where's that?

MARIA MARCILLA: Right here on West Clay, Manuel Vasquez. We rented from him. There was, you know, the town was changing about that time in 1950. Because right here, I can tell you, starting from San Francisco here that there is the Western Liquor. That was the only building that was a good building. And then next to the Western Liquor was the union hall, Southwest Union Hall for the employees. And there was just an old ratty building, you know, real bad. And the laundry wasn't that way either. The Flagstaff Laundry here, Mr. and Mrs. Montoya's laundry wasn't there. It was just a building, you know, a wooden one. And then the years came, you know, and they started building real nice places.

SUSAN ROGERS: About in the fifties?

MARIA MARCILLA: Yes, around the fifties is when the town started changing and growing, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: So you think like all of South San Francisco was more or less built in the fifties?

MRS. FRIAS: Yes. More or less, because, well, some of these buildings, like this place where I'm at now, it was already built. First, this restaurant was an old place, an old house, and now this house, where this restaurant is started first is now here in South Agassiz. It's in a house there. They moved this house, and then they built this restaurant.

SUSAN ROGERS: There moved a lot of houses then, didn't they?

MARIA MARCILLA: Uh-huh. And the only building I think about the same is right here at Knesh Clothes. Right here in front of us.

SUSAN ROGERS: Where Fresco’s-

MRS. FRIAS: Uh-huh, where Fresco's used to be. It's the only one. But other than that, there is a lot of changes, just being around here.

SUSAN ROGERS: What about that Downtowner Motel? It's been there a long time.

MARIA MARCILLA: It has been there for a long, long time. And then the depot, like the Greyhound depot, it wasn't there when we came. And this place, it was over here on East Santa Fe. And then the mortuary, too. The Flagstaff Mortuary, they change it in 1957 to the new one.

MRS. FRIAS: It used to be pretty close to the Monte Vista.

SUSAN ROGERS: The mortuary?

MARIA MARCILLA: Uh-huh. And then the Greyhound was just in a small place, tiny, little bitty place.

MRS. FRIAS: I remember that kind of depot, long time ago, ____ over there ________.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember that one?

MRS. FRIAS: Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Was it a big activity to go down there to see the train?

MRS. FRIAS: Oh, yeah.

MARIA MARCILLA: They have the running water, you know, the fountain that is there. Have you seen the fountain?

SUSAN ROGERS: At the old one? I haven't really looked at the old one. I'll have to go look.

MARIA MARCILLA: And I think a lot of things are changing because people used to, you know.... Well, especially here on 'Frisco, when you live around, I think living here almost twenty years. It changed from one thing to another, and a lot of buildings are tearing it up and all that, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: Well, like when you lived over there in Milton, did you ever come over here? Was there anything?

MARIA MARCILLA: Yes, my dad used to bring us over here to visit the Cancino because it was a barbershop, is a barbershop, Mr. Cancino.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, uh-huh.

MARIA MARCILLA: I think the only thing there is changed is this place, because there was an old house, and the mission here was a house and a little store. And El Rancho Grande is an old building. And all these buildings here in front of us has been there, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: What about over on Beaver Street?

MARIA MARCILLA: Well, the houses are being the same there, because they hadn't done- only the ones that they throw away, _______ Beaver is the same houses, you know. And Clay, too. The only new one, I think is in- I think, is where is the community center is. And you know, the outhouses that used to be there, that they already throw it away, the parking at the university. And when you used to come from Milton Road to where is that way, it used to be a little park there. In Spanish they used to call it Ilanito. You know, people used to come, just walking from there, because they made a causeway, you know. And then in the middle where the station is, in the park, in the corners there where is coming to crossing to Gables, there was a little park there, sitting down, just like a new one that they make over here for the university, and little benches and everything. We used to play a lot over there, too. (Spanish conversation) From the Gables down where there is ________ and all that, there used to be wooden sidewalks. And houses, you know, there was, I guess those people that used to live there, there were wooden houses, but they were two-story houses. Those were the families with a lot of children, their parents used to work at the mill. And then, when they moved us to South  Beaver from a school over there, over here was - I guess I only stayed there about two years in school in South  Beaver.

SUSAN ROGERS: And then where'd you go?

MRS. FRIAS: I went to <Mexico>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, that's when you moved to <Mexico>.

MRS. FRIAS: Uh-huh. Because my husband wanted my children to <Mexico>, you know, to learn Spanish.

MARIA MARCILLA: And most of the people over there that used to live in there in Old Town, they were Mexican people.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you have special Mexican festivals that you used to celebrate?

MARIA MARCILLA: Yes, they used to celebrate a lot. Well, especially in church. They used to celebrate a lot, December 12. And they used to have a fiesta, Mexican people. All from that side, you know, most from all that side, they used to have a bus and everything, and celebrate the Sixteenth of September and Epiphany. But now, you know, the culture is disappearing little by little.

SUSAN ROGERS: What church did you go to then?

MARIA MARCILLA: Guadalupe.

SUSAN ROGERS: It was Guadalupe?

MARIA MARCILLA: Uh-huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: And you used to be able to walk to there easily?

MARIA MARCILLA: Yes. And those stations that are there, you know, the old station where is the motel, coming ____ from Milton Road to Guadalupe, they have never changed, they are still the same. (Spanish) The E-Z mill used to be the armory, the National Guard Armory.

SUSAN ROGERS: I didn't know that.

MARIA MARCILLA: Yeah, that used to be the National Guard.

MRS. FRIAS: Mr. Dolan give us the property for the priests, for the Guadalupe Church. Father Lindemeyer-

MARIA MARCILLA: A lot of things have changed. (Spanish conversation)

MARIA MARCILLA: Over there, at the E-Z Mills, now that used to be the National Guard, they used to have dances, all kinds of affairs. Dances and they used to have Fourth of Julys and thing, you know, like a dance or something, and everybody used to dance _________.

MRS. FRIAS: Yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: When you lived in Milton?

MARIA MARCILLA: Uh-huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: What happened during the day?

MRS. FRIAS: The powwow.

MARIA MARCILLA: They'd have the powwow and then the carnival. And then you go and see the Indian dance. A long time ago the powwow had more meaning for the people than now. It's fading away. Because I think nowadays they do it more for money, where a long time ago they didn't.

SUSAN ROGERS: When you went to school at Beaver, were there some Indians in any of your classes, or not?

MARIA MARCILLA: Yes, uh-huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: And where did they live?

MARIA MARCILLA: Well, they used to live here a lot here in South O'Leary. And they used to bring them from Bellemont. Let's see, a bus used to come. I don't know where they used to bring them, but I think they just took on some from Clark Homes about that time. They used to bring 'em from Clark Homes and all that section of town. And they didn't have no color.... You know, by that time there wasn’t discrimination. They didn't have no black people at all. They used to have Dunbar School here, where it's the Murdock Center. And then there was a school there, and an old school. It used to be- you know where’s Murdock Center, and then the other block, there used to be an old church and then old school. It used to be owned by the Harpers, Harper's Furniture.

SUSAN ROGERS: Was that a Catholic school? (Spanish conversation)

MARIA MARCILLA: It was like the first Catholic church that we had there. And then was a red brick building, and it used to be real, real old. They used to call it like a haunted house. Later on in the fifties, they used to call it like that, because it was just empty.

SUSAN ROGERS: But you never went to church there?

(unintelligible conversation)

SUSAN ROGERS: What were you saying about the blacks? They had their own school?

MARIA MARCILLA: Yes, Murdock Center.

SUSAN ROGERS: Tell me a little bit about that. I've never heard about that.

MARIA MARCILLA: Well, they had their own school there. They used to be called Dunbar School.

SUSAN ROGERS: And when was that? The fifties?

JACINTA: Yes. When I came in <Flagstaff> in 1950, Dunbar School was still with teachers there, just for colored people.

When they moved the children to the schools is when they started to - they named the school after this teacher- Murdock Center. Mrs. Grady Neal, she will give you some information about Dunbar, because she knows all the information about it- research. We had our research for this lady, Mrs. Murdock.

SUSAN ROGERS: And then where was the school?

MARIA MARCILLA: The school was in front of the parking place where they had the school.

SUSAN ROGERS: And that's where you went?

MARIA MARCILLA: Uh-huh, that's where I only went one day.

SUSAN ROGERS: And then you went back to Beaver School?

MARIA MARCILLA: No, then I went to training because this was before they opened Beaver - they had the training school. Now it's the university, and an elementary school.

SUSAN ROGERS: More comfortable, huh? Right.

MRS. FRIAS: Other times, when I go to <Phoenix>, I go in the caboose.

Everybody ate lunch there, and then go again.

SUSAN ROGERS: And so was it like a day trip? It takes a day?

And I and a lot of people, this is when - and I think - in 19- uh, my mother lived. 19- 19- 1929, everybody run with the big tubs or barrels or something, to wait 'til the machine coming, you know, and Mrs. Dolan put for EVERYONE, a lot of hot water for the wash.

And then you had to cover all the windows, and I remember that experience. We even cover with a blanket.... (several talking at once)

SUSAN ROGERS: Was that scary for you?

MARIA MARCILLA: It was the kind of experience, you know, that you had to be more or less prepared, because when they sound the alarm, you had to be covered (several talking at once) and all that, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember any kind of big celebration when the war was over in <Flagstaff>?

MRS. FRIAS: No, I wasn't here at that time in Flag. I was in <Mexico> at that time, you know. I took my kids to <Mexico>.

Can I tell you about the Indians? (several talking at once) Sometimes, you know, the Indians are not allowed to buy any liquor in the fifties. Well, I guess through the time that they had this law, you know, they had to come to 'Frisco Street to get their liquor. And there used to be all kinds - I'm not saying only one particular race, but all kinds of races used to sell the liquor - or people, you know, to the Indians, you know, for higher prices than used to buy from the bars or from the liquor stores.

MARIA MARCILLA: There was really ________ Mexican _________. You know- let’s see, Woodmen of the World-

SUSAN ROGERS: Tell me a little bit about those.

MARIA MARCILLA: Woodmen used to have- you know, their funerals. Woodmen of the World used to have a lot of memberships, and still they do here, yes, but they don't get together, but they used to a long time ago. Woodmen of the World especially when people died, they'd all get together, go to the funeral. (several talking at once) And when the funeral was on, they used to have their white gloves and everything, really do it real nice. And now I don???t know- (two conversations going at same time)

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, let's go back to when you celebrated some of the Mexican holidays. Tell me what you did.

MRS. FRIAS: Well, right here, the last one that we celebrated was really a good celebration. They just dancing the Mexican hat dance, sing some songs, you know. You know, like a queen and a king, and then there was a marcha. Everybody'd get together and have a real good time.

SUSAN ROGERS: Where did you usually have these things?

MRS. FRIAS: At the National Guard Armory, over here where E-Z mills.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you used to ever go to any parties at the Bank Hotel? Do you remember that at all?

MRS. FRIAS: At the Monte Vista. I worked there for eight years.

SUSAN ROGERS: You worked there for eight years? For parties and things?

MRS. FRIAS: Parties.

SUSAN ROGERS: Describe one to me, tell me what they were like.

MRS. FRIAS: (in Spanish) They used to have parties there, real private parties, and movie stars. There were no motels. The Monte Vista was, I think, the first restaurant that had a coffee shop and private dining rooms, you know. In those years, the Monte Vista really had the business, you know, because it was real nice and everything. Of course, in those years, we didn't have no Little America, no Holiday Inn or anything. (several talking at once) But going into the place, have you ever been inside that place?

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh-huh.

MRS. FRIAS: - and the kitchen and all that?

SUSAN ROGERS: No, not ______.

MRS. FRIAS: Well, in the kitchen I had gone to all these places, you know, the Little America, the Holiday Inn, and I cannot find another kitchen like the Monte Vista, because Monte Vista had everything arranged for all the cooks, the salad girl, separate stations for each one of them to work.

SUSAN ROGERS: Who designed that, do you know?

MRS. FRIAS: No, I don't know who designed it. In those years it was just like.... best restaurant.

MARIA MARCILLA: Jacinta, made of pewter, huh?

MRS. FRIAS: Yes, uh-huh.

MARIA MARCILLA: The big stones, because that's the old kitchen. Probably that came from <Boston>, from the East, because pewter and copper, in those days, was in use.

MRS. FRIAS: ____________.

SUSAN ROGERS: Tell me about the development of your business here, how you got into this.

MARIA MARCILLA: Well, I got into business because I used to work.... I got into this restaurant business, to tell you the truth, is because when we graduated from school we didn't have the chances that teenagers have now. You know, when you graduated from high school nowadays you are ready to go, trained for a job, like a secretary job, different kinds of fields that you like to take. Because in those years, when I graduated, we didn't have, like the opportunity. ________ we were in school, we didn't have the opportunity that these children have now, because we had to go out to find a job for ourselves. And the only place you could find a job was a restaurant or a motel or in the five-and-ten, or in theaters. Otherwise, most of my schoolmates who graduated from the university now, some of them, I knew them when they were working as a waitress to get through school. They had these chances that these children have now. But, when I started working, first I started working a dishwasher.

SUSAN ROGERS: In <Flagstaff>?

MARIA MARCILLA: Yes, in <Flagstaff>, in the Flamingo Restaurant. That's an old restaurant that used to be there in the Flamingo Motel; the Flamingo Restaurant. And then after that, I think I worked at the Monte Vista. And then the salad lady that was there, she showed me how to do- you know, trained me for three months, because she was quitting, she was getting a retirement plan over there on the job, and she left me her job, then. So that's how I became interested in the restaurant business.

SUSAN ROGERS: And how did you end up having this place here?

MARIA MARCILLA: Well, after I got married, my husband and my mom, they knew Mr. ____ White. But he's not the real owner of the place. The real owner of the place, she just passed away, Mrs. de Miguel. She was the first one that built this place, and she was the first that opened this place. And then she leased it to people, then to Mr. and Mrs. Jauregui. And then she ran it again by herself, and then she rented it again, or leased it to Mr. Ben White(?). And he always used to sell tamales. That’s all he used to sell, all kinds of tamales, enchiladas and tamales. And then about that time that I got married in 1961, he was going to sell the place, because he got sick, and my mother and my husband got the lease for me. And that's how I became interested.

SUSAN ROGERS: Well, you've covered a whole lot for me. Can you think of anything else that you want to say?

MRS. FRIAS: No, that's it.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, fine.

MARIA MARCILLA: Well, you know, over there were is <Flagstaff>, it used to be, it wasn't so many houses over there, you know. But they are building, and this new shopping center were is K-Mart and all those places. That used to be fields planted in beans. (Spanish conversation)

MARIA MARCILLA: And then did they tell you about the Catholic Church, St. Pius?

SUSAN ROGERS: No, go ahead.

MARIA MARCILLA: Well, St. Pius did not used to be there. St. Pius was just small building. The church, the early church, I think they had the community center, not on this side, but the Montessori School. Behind Montessori there is - the corner _______ there is a building there, where they do sale paintings. I don't know whether they still have it or not. But there used to be just an old building there. They built a building, but they only have quite a few [benches?]. And they have St. Pius Church first. There was ___________. That is when the town started building and building over there in East <Flagstaff>. But, you know, there were not so many businesses either there in that Santa Fe at all. There were just a few businesses in the fifties. And then it started growing up and growing up.

SUSAN ROGERS: Growing up more.

MARIA MARCILLA: Yes, uh-huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: What about, tell me about some of your trips to maybe <Oak Creek> or the <Grand Canyon>.

MARIA MARCILLA: <Oak Creek> and the <Grand Canyon>.

SUSAN ROGERS: _________. (several talking at once, mostly in Spanish, someone mentioned Black Canyon Road, and gravel roads) ?: -make it in 4 hours, five, six hours to come.

JACINTA: Not everybody DID have a car, no. They used to go by bus.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, there was a bus going down there?

MRS. FRIAS: Uh-huh. (in Spanish) Donkeys.

SUSAN ROGERS: Donkeys? __________, in a carriage, or what?

MRS. FRIAS: No, but burros. (several talking at once, mostly in Spanish)

SUSAN ROGERS: _________ on the highway?

MARIA MARCILLA: Uh-huh. I think I used to see him, and I haven't seen him lately. The last time I saw him was about five years ago. He'd just not drive anymore.

SUSAN ROGERS: Didn't he used to go right on the highway?

MARIA MARCILLA: Uh-huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: I think I used to see him, too. And I haven't seen him for years.

MARIA MARCILLA: Years and years and years.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you used to ever talk to him or anything? Do you know anything about him?

MARIA MARCILLA: Uh-huh, he used to stop here in front of my place and stay there all day and all that.

SUSAN ROGERS: Where was he from, or what was he doing?

MARIA MARCILLA: Well, I guess he used to come all the way from Sonora, you know, with his wagon and all that, and go all over - I guess all over the <United States>, because he was travelling. Did they tell about the hospital?

SUSAN ROGERS: Go ahead and tell.

MARIA MARCILLA: Well, the hospital was built in 1936 by Dr. Sechrist. And then they had these- just two rooms. You know where they had the intensive care? Now the new intensive care, they had just two rooms.

SUSAN ROGERS: That was it, huh.

MARIA MARCILLA: Uh-huh, and then where is now where they take your blood test, that used to be the operating room. But only a small hospital.

SUSAN ROGERS: Were you born in a hospital or born at home?

MARIA MARCILLA: Yes, I was born in a hospital.

SUSAN ROGERS: You were born in <Flagstaff>. I thought.... Okay.

MARIA MARCILLA:andgt; I was the second child to be born in that hospital. (laughter)

SUSAN ROGERS: Your claim to fame! (laughter) (several talking at once)

SUSAN ROGERS: Two pounds?!

MARIA MARCILLA: And two ounces.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, my gosh!

MARIA MARCILLA: Two pounds and two ounces. And look at now! (several talking at once) And then later on they started adding and adding more - more things for the hospital. They used to have this iron lung. Have you heard about the iron lung?

SUSAN ROGERS: I haven’t seen one.

MARIA MARCILLA: Well, they had one in the hospital here in <Flagstaff>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Huh, I didn't know that.

MARIA MARCILLA: You just ask Mr. Gold and he takes you where they have a room just for the iron lung. Well, they don't use it anymore. I don't know why they don't use it, but anyway, they have it over there, because the other day I asked him to take me to see the iron lung, you know. And where is the entrance now, to the hospital, they started changing and changing and changing the hospital so much that now where is the entrance, they used to have the intensive care unit, in the fifties, around there. And then they changed intensive care, where they have surgery. (several talking at once) And they have just two rooms as intensive care. And then they change it to other side. And then they have more rooms. (several talking at once)

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh-huh, sure.

MARIA MARCILLA: There is a garage there, you know. I think it's Bill's or something. And there used to be a skating rink there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Really. Right there.

MRS. FRIAS: A long time ago. Close[ed] about three years.

JACINTA: When did the university start?

MARIA MARCILLA: In the fifties. The university? No. It was a college first. But in the fifties it started growing and growing ____ the university.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you go to high school there?

MARIA MARCILLA: I went to high school over here.

SUSAN ROGERS: And that's the one that's been torn down?

MARIA MARCILLA: Yes, the one that was torn down.

SUSAN ROGERS: Can you tell me a little bit about that old building?

MARIA MARCILLA: The old building that used to have a downstairs. Downstairs, and then there was a middle, and then the upstairs.

SUSAN ROGERS: Really?

MARIA MARCILLA: Uh-huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: And where was it located?

MARIA MARCILLA: Over here where is the Miltown(?). Coming down, you know where is the auditorium, just right there in the middle of the new one. _________.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, about the same area, then?

MARIA MARCILLA: Uh-huh, and that is a beautiful building. It was really a nice building. And every year when you graduate, they said, "Well, we have more children, more students graduating this year." So when I graduated was the biggest class that we graduated.

SUSAN ROGERS: How big was that about?

MARIA MARCILLA: A hundred twenty-seven students.

SUSAN ROGERS: That's pretty big, really, for that day.

MARIA MARCILLA: Yes. So, it was, you know, it was growing. Then there was no other high school. There was only one Flagstaff high school.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you ever used to go to the Peaks?

MARIA MARCILLA: Yes, uh-huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: What kind of road was that, or what kind of trip?

MARIA MARCILLA: Well, the road was not paved or anything, it was just gravel.

SUSAN ROGERS: Was it basically the same road?

MARIA MARCILLA: Yes, uh-huh, the same road.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you ski?

MARIA MARCILLA: No.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did people ski then?

MARIA MARCILLA: Uh-huh.

JACINTA: I understand that you swim. (several talking at the same time)

MARIA MARCILLA: Let me tell you one thing, another thing. We went, one summertime around in '53 to the Peaks. And it's cold there. It's real, real cold.

SUSAN ROGERS: You went up in the wintertime, you mean?

MARIA MARCILLA: No, in summertime.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, in summertime!

MARIA MARCILLA: Have you ever been in summertime over there?

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah, it's nice.

MARIA MARCILLA: And it's cold. It's not as hot as here.

SUSAN ROGERS: Where did you used to swim, Maria?

MARIA MARCILLA: Over here at the high school. (several talking at once)

JACINTA: Not at the lakes, though, no.

MRS. FRIAS: She won a prize in swimming.

SUSAN ROGERS: You did? In high school? (

MARIA MARCILLA: Uh-huh.) Was there a swim team?

MARIA MARCILLA: No, we took classes. That's all. I guess you need some more information.

SUSAN ROGERS: Well, can you think of anything else? You think that's about it? Shall I turn it off for a little bit?

MARIA MARCILLA: Yes, I guess.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. (tape turned off and on)

MARIA MARCILLA: Can I tell my feelings about San Francisco?

SUSAN ROGERS: Sure, go ahead.

MRS. FRIAS: You know, sometimes people think that San Francisco Street is a bad street, you know, where it's only ladies in the doors. (laughter) (several talking at once) It is NOT! You know that I made a research for young people, they were raised here in 'Frisco in the 1930s, 1920s, they lived here on 'Frisco. Do you know what they've been telling me? I asked them, "By any chance, has anybody, when you were young, around eighteen or nineteen, any lady tried to pull you in or tried to, you know, tried to make money with you?" and they said, "I never saw a lady doing that here on 'Frisco Street." Even educated people. Educated people, their parents that raised them over here on 'Frisco, they have a very good education and everything, but they.... And I asked them, you know, and they [said], "We never knew anybody that do that kind of business." (two conversations going at the same time)

SUSAN ROGERS: How did it get that reputation?

MARIA MARCILLA: Well, you know, I don't know, because people have that idea that 'Frisco is really a bad street. I don't know how they got this way. Since I've been living here all my life....

SUSAN ROGERS: Never.

MARIA MARCILLA: Never, unt-uh. You know, you can go out at any hour of the night, and nobody bothers you. As long as you don't bother nobody, nobody bothers you. You know? Because sometimes they have that idea. And most people, they don't want to drive their cars to 'Frisco Street. They're scared. They are afraid to pass by because they think there is a lot of drunk people in the streets, ________. But let me tell you sometimes.... You know, like the other day we were all talking in a meeting and these people asked me, they said, "Oh, well, there at 'Frisco there is a lot of drunkards and everything." I said, "Let me take you right now." It was on Friday night, and I give them a ride in my car, and they didn't even see anybody in the streets. Everybody was minding their own business.

SUSAN ROGERS: Great. 

MRS. FRIAS: Uh-huh. Do you think there's any one street in town that is like that?

MARIA MARCILLA: I don't think so. But you know, I think like a long time ago they had this in the twenties, in the thirties, you know. They had - well, especially, I think that the street got the bad name because there were certain places or certain houses where there were women, you know, that used to do all that kind of business, but not anymore. They don't do it anymore, or didn't do it plainly, you know what I mean? But now, this idea is for some people, sometimes, they have that idea that 'Frisco is a bad street. And it's not! Because I've been living my life here. (several talking at once) You know, you can go out anytime and you go to your business ___________. (several talking at once) Do you know what? How many times I leave open this door and then I.... Nobody coming in.

SUSAN ROGERS: Even now?

MARIA MARCILLA: Even now. (in Spanish) ... about a week ago. The door open, all night and then go to town, me and Maria, and nobody coming in. Was only five o'clock, two American people come in and sit down and said, "I'm waiting for my dinner!" (Spanish) (laughter) And I already go to the kitchen. It's okay. (several talking at once)

MRS. FRIAS: And then most of the people is going away, you know, they got these opportunities and want to better themselves, have a better job. They're moving away with their families, you know. We had quite a few black people, but not as many as we used to, because they're already moving to different places, to different sections of town, because they had a better job, they had bettered theirselves up, you know. (Spanish conversation)

MRS. FRIAS: You know, the older people, the grandpeople, the old people, and these young ones, too, they are nice, they don't bother nobody. They're human beings, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: Sure.

MARIA MARCILLA: You know what I mean? Like they said, "If you don't bother them, they don't bother you." That's all. But they are nice people. Some people.... Well, I remember when the Civil Rights were on. There were some kind of complaints about, you know.... One time we had some.... And this.... Can I say?

SUSAN ROGERS: Sure.

MARIA MARCILLA: -local paper. It was some kind of a riot. Well, anyway, and guess who started the riot? A Mexican fellow started the riot instead of black people. And pretty soon we have all the police, you know, coming in and everything, and of course they got mad because they didn't start it, you know. And then later on.... Well, this thing went on for three days. And then the next day some ladies were just hanging around there in the middle of the street - black ladies were hanging around and dancing and everything. And I came out and told them, "Don't do that, because that's very wrong. There is nothing you can do about it. Just let it go." And finally they understood and they went home. That's not the point, to say, "You are doing this." No. But when those things started, it was not only the black people, it was ALL races, because I saw it with my eyes. And people were afraid and thinking they were going to do anything. And let me tell you, not the people here from <Flagstaff> - it was people from out of town. You know, because in those days I have a lot of strange faces coming into my place, and see a lot of things. But it’s not, you know. And then like here, well, they are bettering themselves, they have better houses, they have better facilities and everything. But I knew that there was some discrimination where they were not allowed to go anyplace. But I let them come in my place. That's why I closed my dining room. I used to have a dining room area, over there. And it happens that this man came in you know, when first we got the place. And he asked me. He called me aside there and said, "Maria, you'd better tell this black fellow to get out of the dining room, because I don't want to eat here, and my family, with him." Then I told him, "Well, let me tell you, sir, this is the first and the last time you're going to be eating here, too." (laughter) "If you like my food, and if you want to come into MY business, from now on you have to eat with EVERYONE, all together, because that man is not doing any harm to you." And I didn't told him anything. And then he said, "Well, I'm going to walk out." And I said, "Go ahead." But I [didn't tell] this black fellow to get out or anything.

SUSAN ROGERS: Were they discriminated against in town quite a bit?

MARIA MARCILLA: Well, sometimes they did.

SUSAN ROGERS: They weren't allowed into certain restaurants?

MARIA MARCILLA: Yes, into certain restaurants. Well, in most restaurants.... Well, I have a friend that she says, "I was allowed in every place to go and eat, as long as I behaved. But if I started hollering and trying to do some kind of noise, they don't allow it." But some, they were well-behaved, and they go dressed and everything, they allowed them to come in their places. But in some places, they didn't allow to go. But in most of the stores, I have seen it here in <Flagstaff>, they can go and buy anything they want in all the stores. As a matter of fact, when they were doing that thing, you know, some kind of a riot those days, I said, "Why are they doing it?" But I knew they were not.... They were antagonated [antagonized] because the police came and tried to blame. And the people, and all of them people, that they were not doing anything, you know. And I said, "Well, I wonder why they are doing this. They are all the time being treated right," because I saw it with my own eyes.

My brother had gone to <Texas>. In 1954 he went to <Texas>, and he saw over there in <Texas>, in some of the stores, that they have one part of the stock for Mexican people, and another one for black people, and another one for white people. __________. So when he came over here to <Flagstaff> again, he went for two weeks, and he came back and he said, "Sister, I am sorry, we are treated better here in <Flagstaff>."

SUSAN ROGERS: There was never anything like that here?

MARIA MARCILLA: No, it was never here in <Flagstaff>, I don't think so. I guess in certain places, you know, but not in....

SUSAN ROGERS: But it was never separated _________.

MRS. FRIAS: Separated, no. Like now, I notice that they live in different sections of town, they have, you know.... Which I think is right. You know, because let me tell you, when you go and spend your money, to any store, to any place, when that money is green, it's green.

SUSAN ROGERS: Sure.

MARIA MARCILLA: It doesn't say, "Who is black or white or what." They didn't say, you know. I believe that they should have the equal rights. But now, you know, I hear different type of people saying this about "Why did they let them go to different places?" And they think that because they give them the right to do all these things, they're getting kind of big. I don't think so, because they deserve to be equal, like anybody. I think that a long time ago they should have given them their rights. Like the Indian people, too. The Indian people, too, they should have their rights, too, like anybody, because they.... I don't know why they did that, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember any special times, the Indians having problems in town here?

MARIA MARCILLA: Well, yes, when they had the bootleggers.

SUSAN ROGERS: What was the main problem with that?

MARIA MARCILLA: The main problem, they were not allowed to buy liquor. No. Do you think that was right?

SUSAN ROGERS: No, I don't think so. But they were allowed to go in all the stores and everything.

MARIA MARCILLA: Well, they liked to go in. And you know, people here on 'Frisco nowadays, since the Powwow, you know, since they started selling the liquor to the Indian people, they think that their business came down because Indian people don't come to the south side anymore. I don't believe that. They think because there is more.... Well, there is a liquor store near to the tracks over there, and _______. There is another one on Beaver.

SUSAN ROGERS: Access.

MARIA MARCILLA: Yes. And they think that because they don't come and do business here, because of that. And I said, "No, it's not that. If they want to come to the south side, they come to the south side." But sometimes they have these impressions, you know. This is what the street is about. Every time something happens, they blame it on the south side sometimes. Uh-huh. I have some friends in <Phoenix>. One Fourth of July they called me and I asked them to come, and then these people, friends of mine, had gone to <Phoenix>, and they told them right here we had all drunk people, and all drunk Indians. That's bad, you know. I don't like that, you know. They shouldn't say that to- nobody's REALLY true about south side. But it's happening. Of course, you know, we have poor people on the south side. Not everyone is rich, but we have all kind of people in different sections. But they only say, "South side, south side, 'Frisco." The only thing they hear that is 'Frisco and 'Frisco.

(several talking at once)

JACINTA: Frisco is a wonderful name of a saint, San Francisco.

MARIA MARCILLA: This street is not what people think it is, you know. I think they should live at least one month or two months to see for themselves that it's a GOOD neighborhood, that you can live like anybody else, and have your own things here on 'Frisco and all that, you know. Like here, Mrs. Cancino here, she's paralyzed and everything, and her husband now is in the hospital. I just went the other day, and she says, "Everybody's been so nice here on 'Frisco, all the people, around here came and offer me some help to shovel the snow and everything." She says, "At least I'm not alone anymore." But I don't know why they have that idea. I have heard people that they don't even want to cross; crossing the tracks is bad.

JACINTA: It's a romantic idea too, I guess. You know, college part of the town, the voodoo. And this is kind of.... Like it's sort of building a history or mystery about it, and they build their own ego in themselves, and the people.

MARIA MARCILLA: And I think like this boy, he's writing his book, I told him to put the name of the title, "The Street That People Think It Isn't."

JACINTA: I think that's beautiful! (laughs)

SUSAN ROGERS: It is, it is.

MARIA MARCILLA: Uh-huh, because you know and research, and see how many people, you know. There is people that they have in here eighteen children, raised eighteen children in one little room.

SUSAN ROGERS: On this street?

MARIA MARCILLA: Uh-huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now?

MARIA MARCILLA: Now. And still Mr. Luna, Mrs. Luna, Pepeto Luna, they will tell you that his wife had eighteen children, and he raised the family in one little room, in one room. (Spanish conversation)

MRS. FRIAS: Si, and he still has the room.

SUSAN ROGERS: I'll bet he has more, too, huh?

MARIA MARCILLA: Uh-huh, he owns house. (several talking at once) And let me tell you, his family, you know. Very clean, a real nice family here. My daughter would have teachers from 'Frisco. We have different kinds of people - painters - and good people. (two conversations going at the same time) People think that all well-educated people. But otherwise, you know, they just think there is a bad history, but it's not good. (two conversations still going)

SUSAN ROGERS: I don't think there's really a bad street IN <Flagstaff>.

MARIA MARCILLA: No. Sometimes, you know, in summertime, the noise of the people. People like to go out and stay out and all that, but it's not - people sometimes, they not even live here, are the ones that come and make the noise - not the people that live here.

SUSAN ROGERS: Right.

MARIA MARCILLA: We just have the street here. And I think if I ever build me another business, I'll build it here on 'Frisco. (Spanish conversation)

MARIA MARCILLA: And you know sometimes people are putting a lot of.... You know, like here, next door, we had Shakey Drakes, Shakey Drakes, but before there was a restaurant and a bar, and I think it was most like the first Mexican restaurant, you know. It was a real, real nice building. It used to be called Griego’s Café. Emily Griego used to run the place, and Mr. Joe Griego.

Well, anyway, after that, they went into, you know, she really had a beautiful place, you know. But like I said, everything comes to the end, you know. And then finally she didn't keep it, she rented it to somebody else and they disfigured the place and all that. And finally they had Shakey Drakes, you know, which the Zanzucchi’s run now. And they all the time said, you know, people is putting complaints to Shakey Drakes about the noise and everything. And I told the Zanzucchis, "I am the one that is supposed to put the complaint to do it, and I'm not even putting on."

SUSAN ROGERS: You're not the one.

MARIA MARCILLA: Because they have their business to run, too.

SUSAN ROGERS: Sure. That's good of you.

MARIA MARCILLA: So.... (laughs)

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you have anything else?

MARIA MARCILLA: I guess that would be about all.
