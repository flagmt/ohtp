SUSAN ROGERS: And your father brought you?

EDUARDO MAYORGA: Yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: Can you tell me a little about your father?

EDUARDO MAYORGA: Not very much, but.... Let me see, couldn't work because....

(in Spanish)

CARMEN LOPEZ: He was ruptured, he couldn't work.

EDUARDO MAYORGA: Yeah, he couldn't work. But Enrique, Fernando....

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: Those were his brothers and sisters that he mentioned.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you go to school here?

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember any of your teachers?

EDUARDO MAYORGA: No, I don't.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember any of your classmates?

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: Mrs. Prochnow was one of his classmates.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, really? What does he remember about her? Do you remember anything, or has he told you anything?

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: No, he doesn't remember.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Maybe it's easier for him to do it in Spanish, do you think? Or not? I'll tell you, and you see, either way. Where did you live when you first came?

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: When they came from <Mexico> they had these like, I don't know what you would call them, they'd get bunches of people and bring 'em across free, and that's how their dad brought them. They had, supposedly, passes to take them all the way to <San Francisco>, but they dropped them off here, <Cosnino>. And that's as far as they brought 'em. (Spanish) His dad didn't like it there, because it was just a little railroad stop, that’s what it was.

SUSAN ROGERS: Were they on the train, you mean, or what?

CARMEN LOPEZ: Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, and how many of 'em were put off here?

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: Just his family.

SUSAN ROGERS: Where did they go when they first arrived? What did they do?

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: That night they slept outside. (Spanish) And his dad didn't like it, naturally, so he asked a caretaker there about a section house, what was the nearest town. (Spanish) Which was <Flagstaff>. So then he waited for the next train that passed, and the train brought him into <Flagstaff>. That I know, 'cause he's told me _______.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Can he describe the first day in <Flagstaff>, like how they found work or what they did?

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: First they found jobs, and then he got them in school.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, what kind of jobs would they do?

(Spanish conversation)

EDWARDO MAYORGA: I don't remember. I wasn't working, nor my brothers.

SUSAN ROGERS: You were too young, right?

EDUARDO MAYORGA: Yeah. You have to remember that I didn't like the school because I didn't know what's all about it, until I pick up a little at a time, a little at a time, _________.

SUSAN ROGERS: What part of town did they live in, then, when they arrived?

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: Where the old spring was, in Old Town. Up on the hill his dad bought a house there right away, and that's where they lived.

SUSAN ROGERS: Is that house still there?

CARMEN LOPEZ: Yeah, it's an old shack now. We visited it just last summer.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you know about the address or what street?

CARMEN LOPEZ: It's on Coconino Avenue, but I don't know the number. It's still up there, though.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember any of your neighbors there?

EDUARDO MAYORGA: No.

CARMEN LOPEZ: (Spanish)

EDUARDO MAYORGA: No.

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: This one lady, Doña Sarapia [phonetic spelling] (Spanish) she used to send him for errands to the store. And he says that didn't like her because she would send him for something and he would write it down so he wouldn't forget it, and he'd bring it and she'd say it wasn't what she wanted. So he would get real upset.

SUSAN ROGERS: What store did you go to in those days?

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: There was a store owned by Mr. Coffin. 

EDUARDO MAYORGA: Joe Coffin.

CARMEN LOPEZ: It was just a little store, and that's where they would buy their groceries, by the underpass, along that area.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you move from there, or did you live there most of your life, then?

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: From there they went to <California> and then his dad didn't like it over there for the family, so he brought them back. (Spanish) He doesn't remember when they came back, but they did come back.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember where they lived then, when you came back the second time?

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: He doesn't remember the location, except that it was a two-story house, and they rented the upstairs to his dad when they came back.

SUSAN ROGERS: Is the house here anymore, or has it been torn down?

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: He says the house is still - he's seen it in Sunnyside, so it must have been over here somewhere in town, when they moved it.

SUSAN ROGERS: Where's Sunnyside?

CARMEN LOPEZ: East Flag. That's what it was.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, that’s what they used to call it, right, was Sunnyside?

CARMEN LOPEZ: Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Do you remember any big celebrations when you were a kid here - maybe Fourth of July, did you used to go?

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: He says for the Fourth of July they would have like an open rodeo, and anyone that wanted to ride the horses or bulls or whatever, could do it. It was for the Fourth of July.

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: He doesn't remember if there were parades.

SUSAN ROGERS: Let me go back on this Sunnyside. Do you know why it was called Sunnyside?

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: He says he thinks it was because it was all ranches over there. I know they were just bean ranches, and the sun would hit the fields right away. He thinks that's why - he's not sure.

SUSAN ROGERS: And apparently they moved a lot of houses from Old <Flagstaff> over to Sunnyside? Does he know anything more about that? Because he said his house, you know, was over there. I don't think it was originally.

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: He just remembers that those houses were on this man's property, but he doesn't remember who the man was. And he wanted his land cleared, and he would give the people the homes if they would move 'em. Apparently they were selling probably lots in East Flag, so they just would move 'em.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. What do you remember about the downtown area when you were little? Did you used to go down there?

(Spanish conversation)

SUSAN ROGERS: Didn't go downtown very much, huh?

CARMEN LOPEZ: No. He says all he can remember was the Babbitts', that was there all the time.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did he used to do a lot of shopping there?

(Spanish conversation)

EDUARDO MAYORGA: No, (Spanish).

CARMEN LOPEZ: They did most of the __________.

SUSAN ROGERS: Can you describe Joe Coffin? Do you remember him?

EDUARDO MAYORGA: I remember one thing, that I liked him. (chuckles) He had a store, and I don't know what happened to him __________ Friday. And what I like, everything was, anything (?), we didn't have to go outside, just went in (?).

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: He was a tall, big man, and he was an older man when he was [there].

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Do you remember any big fires or floods?

(Spanish conversation)

EDUARDO MAYORGA: No.

SUSAN ROGERS: Blizzards? Big snows?

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: He remembers a lot of snow.

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: He says the river would usually carry all the water...

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: ... and the big snows.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember the flu epidemic of 1918?

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: He says everybody was sick.

SUSAN ROGERS: Were any of his neighbors or close friends very sick?

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: He says all they got was like fever for a couple of days, but that was it.

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: Three or four of their neighbors died. He doesn't remember their names, but he remembers they died.

SUSAN ROGERS: With the same thing. How did the lumber companies treat you? Did they treat you pretty good?

EDUARDO MAYORGA: Pretty good.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you think your wages were fair, your pay?

(Spanish conversation)

EDUARDO MAYORGA: Yes, I think so.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you know Mr. Dolan?

EDUARDO MAYORGA: Oh, yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: What was he like?

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh! Uh-huh, uh-huh. Do you remember anything about him that he's told you?

CARMEN LOPEZ: Mr. Dolan? 

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah, about Mr. Dolan.

CARMEN LOPEZ: Well, what I remember.... Of course, I was a child when he.... We lived close to the mill over there, and for the children of the working men, he would always give Christmas gifts to the children, like the little girls would get dolls. This was for ALL of the families. And the boys would get little trucks and candy and stuff like that. He was always VERY generous, as far as I can remember. Also, we're Catholic, and of course they're Catholic, or they were. If the time that a child would be making their first communion, if their parents couldn't afford to get the dress or the trousers or whatever, they would take them to the store and dress them head to foot. Mrs. Dolan would take them personally.

SUSAN ROGERS: What church did you go to at that time?

CARMEN LOPEZ: I would attend Nativity, because I went to school over there, they sent us over there. So we went over there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did the Dolans also have parties for the employees?

CARMEN LOPEZ: No. No, I don't remember that. (in Spanglish) __________ parties _________. In Christmas, _________ Christmas ________.

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: He says they would give the candies and this to the adults, too, to ALL the men. I don't remember that. I remember little-

SUSAN ROGERS: Little kids.

CARMEN LOPEZ: Right.

SUSAN ROGERS: So at this time you lived in Mill Town?

CARMEN LOPEZ: Yes, when we were young. We moved over here, I guess, in 1940.

SUSAN ROGERS: To this house?

CARMEN LOPEZ: Further down, about two blocks down.

SUSAN ROGERS: How long have you lived in this one here?

CARMEN LOPEZ: We moved over here in 1950. He built the house over there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, can you describe Mill Town to me, since it's not there any longer? What was it like?

CARMEN LOPEZ: Well, the way I remember it....

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: He says when THEY came here, there were already little shacks that people that would work at the mill. And it just kept growing; they kept building new ones or adding to the ones that were there.

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: He says the rent was very low, three dollars a month.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh-huh, and was there water?

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: There were two faucets outside. One at the entrance of the area, and one at _________.

SUSAN ROGERS: So you had to go and get water?

CARMEN LOPEZ: Uh-huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: And was that one of your chores?

CARMEN LOPEZ: Well, WE didn't, because he had put in....

(Spanish conversation)

SUSAN ROGERS: So you had water.

CARMEN LOPEZ: We had our own water. We had hot and cold water, but he did that himself.

SUSAN ROGERS: To your particular house.

CARMEN LOPEZ: Uh-huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: Most of the houses still didn't have.

CARMEN LOPEZ: No. The rest up further didn't have. They had to have like a community outhouse too, and we didn't, we had our own, because he did that.

SUSAN ROGERS: About how many people lived in there?

(Spanish conversation)

SUSAN ROGERS: How many families, if it's easier to do it that way.

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: He says there were three rows of the shacks, and some had men alone, and then they started to bring THEIR families in. And all together he thinks there might be about fifty families.

SUSAN ROGERS: It was all in that area where Bob's Big Boy is?

CARMEN LOPEZ: No. I don't know if they still have that trailer sales - where Taco Bell is. (

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh-huh.)

CARMEN LOPEZ: That. You know where Mr. Dolan's house is. Well, behind Mr. Dolan's.

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah, I know where that trailer place used to be.

CARMEN LOPEZ: Yeah. That's where it.... Right in back of Mr. Dolan's house, all of that area is where it was. There were a few homes where Bob's Big Boy is, but I think there were, oh, maybe five homes, and they were more or less separate. And that was part of the thing, too, ____________. The rest was all to the back. That's where the rows of shacks were - three - three rows. And ours, where we lived, we were right on the front part of the highway, and those houses were very separate from those three rows that I'm telling you. That's how come he did everything. Mr. Dolan let him do however he wanted with the home that we had.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did he know Sisson? S-I-S-S-O-N. Does that name.... It may have been too early. He had a lumber company here. He was a manager of a lumber company. That doesn't ring any bells?

CARMEN LOPEZ: Not to me. I'm sure he would have mentioned it.

(Spanish conversation)

SUSAN ROGERS: I thought I had a question all ready! When you were young, now, where did you go shopping in Mill Town? Was there a store there?

CARMEN LOPEZ: Yeah. The corner where Food Town is, I think there's a music shop. It was Sauer and Hutchinson [phonetic spellings]. It was a grocery store.

SUSAN ROGERS: So that's where you went.

CARMEN LOPEZ: That's where I remember going with my mother for groceries. And also to Babbitts' downtown. And for clothing, well, she would buy everything at J. C. Penney's, or order through....

[END TAPE 1, SIDE 1; BEGIN TAPE 1, SIDE 2]

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, we were talking about J. C. Penney.

CARMEN LOPEZ: Yes, that I remember. It WAS located where ________ furniture [is now].

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you used to go to the company store? Was the company store there or not?

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: There WAS a commissary, and it was right in front, across the street from where the offices are. I think Joe was the one that had [it] - Joe Riordan.

SUSAN ROGERS: Joe Riordan.

CARMEN LOPEZ: Uh-huh, across the street. He says the building was there, and that was the commissary.

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: Yeah, he says they shopped there too.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Do you remember the Mercy Hospital, or what they called the Old Town Hospital?

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: Yeah, he did a lot of the repair work, the plumbing. He says if anything broke they would call him to repair it. But if we would get sick, they would take us there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember going there?

CARMEN LOPEZ: No, I don't remember it myself, but I do remember one of my older brothers cut one of his knees, and we were young then. And I remember them taking him over there.

SUSAN ROGERS: How big of a place was it?

CARMEN LOPEZ: Well, in fact it's still there. (Spanish) It's still there; it's boarded up. That's the one.

SUSAN ROGERS: I was going to ask you about going to school at Nativity, too. That wasn't the school that's there now?

CARMEN LOPEZ: No, it was St. Anthony's.

SUSAN ROGERS: It was kind of a big building, wasn't it?

CARMEN LOPEZ: Yes, at the time.

SUSAN ROGERS: Can you tell me a little bit about it?

CARMEN LOPEZ: Well, we had from first to eighth grade, and ALL of us went to that school. We all finished eighth grade - my five brothers and my sister and myself. They have the Sisters of Lorretta teaching. I have very good memories of it, real happy memories.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you walk to there every day?

CARMEN LOPEZ: Yes, we did, we'd walk.

SUSAN ROGERS: Would you go home for lunch?

CARMEN LOPEZ: Uh-huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: Or would you stay there, oh you walked home for lunch.

CARMEN LOPEZ: Unless the weather was real bad. Then we would take our lunch.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you have any special extracurricular activities that you did there?

CARMEN LOPEZ: Not really. We took piano lessons when I was a kid. Gave us piano lessons, and just, you know, the little plays and stuff that they would have us do - recitals. That's about it.

SUSAN ROGERS: Can you describe that building to me? I've only seen one picture of it.

CARMEN LOPEZ: Well, it had two wings. It was kind of like a "U" shape, and the front part was the auditorium, and then the two wings.

SUSAN ROGERS: Were the classrooms?

CARMEN LOPEZ: Were the classrooms. Then in the center it was closed with glass windows and a door, and it had - they used to call it "the grotto." They had a big Virgin Mary and like a little patio-type thing. I imagine they would use it, like in the summer. It was open; it didn't have a roof. The nuns would live in the back part, upstairs, and had the kitchen and their laundry room. It was big.

SUSAN ROGERS: Which street did it face on?

CARMEN LOPEZ: Like it does now. Is that Cherry? Yeah, Cherry.

SUSAN ROGERS: Or did it face on Dale? Dale's _______.

CARMEN LOPEZ: It faced Cherry.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, what kind of playground was there?

CARMEN LOPEZ: We had no playground equipment, it was just bare.

SUSAN ROGERS: Dirt, huh?

CARMEN LOPEZ: Uh-huh. All we had were baseballs and the bats and like volleyball. That's all we had.

SUSAN ROGERS: And Nativity Church was there.

CARMEN LOPEZ: Yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: But the nuns weren't living in the old white house?

CARMEN LOPEZ: No, they lived right in the school there. They had the back section and the upstairs were their bedrooms. They lived right there.

SUSAN ROGERS: About how many students do you think went? How many teachers did you have?

CARMEN LOPEZ: It must have been four or five teachers, because there were two grades to each room. And I remember the rooms being full. Could have been maybe ten students per grade or something like that.

SUSAN ROGERS: Um, I keep forgetting.

CARMEN LOPEZ: Before it was a school, it was a church.

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: I know that it was a church before it was a school. I wouldn't know the date of that.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you know about what year it was torn down?

CARMEN LOPEZ: Yeah, it was torn down about '50.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you used to ever do anything with the public school kids?

CARMEN LOPEZ: Once in a while we'd have baseball games against, mostly Emerson.

SUSAN ROGERS: Was there a lot of friendly fighting or competition between the two schools?

CARMEN LOPEZ: Oh yeah. There was no problem - I never remember any, anyway, with us girls. I don't know about the boys.

SUSAN ROGERS: Right. Were there any Mexican organizations around town then? Mexican-American?

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: They didn't have any organizations, but they would get together like for the Sixteenth of September, to celebrate.

SUSAN ROGERS: And what did they do at these celebrations? Where were they?

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: They would have a parade and they would take the Mexican flag out and speeches and anyone that wanted to say anything could get up and talk.

SUSAN ROGERS: Where was it? What part of town was the parade in?

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: He doesn't remember for sure. He THINKS it was at San Francisco Street.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you used to come over to do any shopping on San Francisco Street? Or did you used to mainly go to Babbitts'?

CARMEN LOPEZ: I don't think there was anything there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember San Francisco Street? We've had some questions on the development of that street. That's why I was asking.

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: He just remembers a Chinese laundry on San Francisco Street, and a bar, way back then. It later developed, but no grocery stores or nothing.

SUSAN ROGERS: Were there a lot of Chinese in town? Do you remember any, or does he?

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: He remembers more than one family. He doesn't remember who they were.

SUSAN ROGERS: No close associations, nothing like that?

CARMEN LOPEZ: No.

SUSAN ROGERS: How did the Mayorga Welding get started? Who started that?

CARMEN LOPEZ: That's one of his sons, one of my brothers.

SUSAN ROGERS: Can you tell me a little bit about that, how it got started?

CARMEN LOPEZ: Well, he started it. First he worked in the mill also. He came out of the service. He's my fourth brother. Then he quit the mill and he went into business for himself. It was just a little shop, in fact their home is right down the street. And just about maybe four years ago, he built the big shop that he has now. I understand he's doing very well.

SUSAN ROGERS: So, about year was it, '45 or something like that ____________?

CARMEN LOPEZ: Oh, no, I think maybe.... Well, I'm not quite sure, but maybe fifteen years.

CARMEN LOPEZ: It was the mother of Joe Babbitt. I don't know which one she was, but she worked with them until, she said, Joe was a toddler, so she knew all the girls, and I believe Joe was the only boy. They treated her very well; they were very nice to her.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did your mother go to school at Emerson then, too?

CARMEN LOPEZ: Yes, but she didn't like it because she was already old. She said she was nine, I remember that. She was nine and they, of course, put her with the young ones, and she didn't want to go back. So she was in just for a little while.

SUSAN ROGERS: Then she usually just helped her mother then, or something?

CARMEN LOPEZ: Yes, she would go with my grandmother, she would work, because she didn't want to go back to school.

SUSAN ROGERS: What do you remember about World War II in <Flagstaff>? Were there any hardships that it created or anything?

(Spanish conversation)

SUSAN ROGERS: So the lumber mill didn't have any problems at that time?

CARMEN LOPEZ: No. (Spanish) He was working day and night then.

SUSAN ROGERS: You were working MORE, huh?

CARMEN LOPEZ: Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, what about during the Depression? How did that affect <Flagstaff> and the lumber company?

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: During the Depression (Spanish) my dad and his brother were the only ones that were working, because they had to keep the boilers going. They laid off ALL the other men and just him and my uncle were alone with it. So we didn't have any hardships.

SUSAN ROGERS: What happened to those they laid off? Did they move or did they stay around in the area?

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: He says a lot of them stayed on and a lot of them left back to <Mexico>. The ones that stayed ____________.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, I think that's very good. Can you think of anything else that you need to add, or any stories that he may have told you at all?

(Spanish conversation)

CARMEN LOPEZ: He says he added to his age when he started to work so they would hire him, because they wouldn't take him because of his age.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did they ever find out that he did that? (laughs)

(Spanish conversation)

EDUARDO MAYORGA: No. (laughter)

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.
