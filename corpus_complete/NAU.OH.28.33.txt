This is an interview with Mr. and Mrs. Grady and Hazel Neal. Mrs. Neal has been a <Flagstaff> resident since 1929 and Mr. Grady Neal since 1940. The interview is being conducted on January 16, 1976, at 115 South Agassiz in <Flagstaff>, which is their home. The interviewer is Susan L. Rogers, representing the Flagstaff City-Coconino County Public Library.

SUSAN L. ROGERS: Okay, Mr. Neal, when and where were you born?

GRADY NEAL: Warren, <Arkansas>, in 1907.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your parents' background and about your background, and how you eventually arrived in <Flagstaff>?

GRADY NEAL: Well, my father was a minister, a Baptist minister, and I lived in <Arkansas> quite a few years, different places. But in 1940, I had one brother here who was [on?] at that particularly time, so I decided to come west. I got here to <Flagstaff> along in June, I think, of - it might have been a little earlier - in 1940. Well, I worked for the Southwest Forests, and then I worked in different places in building constructions around <Flagstaff>, here, up until the war years, and then I went into the service. I came back to <Flagstaff> in 1945, although I was in the hospital. But then from that I went, after I got out of the hospital, I went to work for Navajo Ordnance Depot and I retired from civil service over there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Now, can you remember your first day when you arrived in <Flagstaff>, where you stayed?

GRADY NEAL: Well, the first night I spent the night in Flagstaff City Hall. (chuckles)

SUSAN ROGERS: You did? (laughs)

GRADY NEAL: Yeah. I came in by freight train, and I got off. I went down to <Canyon Diablo>, I couldn't get off here, the freight was goin' too fast. I was comin' through <Ash Fork> and rode down to <Canyon Diablo>, and then caught another freight. I had another friend with me, and we come back in here about one o'clock, I guess, at night, and was stranded here and didn't know anybody, so I decided I'd turn into (?) city hall, when a policeman down at the service station where - it's a parts place there now, it was Old 66. I went and asked him if he could put us up for the night, and they did. Then the next morning I told him that I had a brother here, and he asked me the name, but he was going by a different name. They called him "Wolf," instead of Garland then. They called him Wolf Neal. So he told me, "Well, I'll go and see if I can find where-" The last letter I got from him, he used the envelope from the Monte Vista Hotel, and I just figured he worked there, but he didn't. He was living up on the hill up there at [Dillard and Miller's?] __________ up next to the Mormon Church up there. And he found him down at Babbitts', the Babbitt Thriftway they called it, where 66 - Joe's Bar now - was Babbitt Thriftway. And he'd come down in the morning and get scraps for his dog. They'd save it for him. And so he come down to the office there. Jim Wright [phonetic spelling] I think was the policeman at that time. But anyway, he talked with him and he said, "No, I don't have any brothers in this part of the country." So he said, "Well, you come and go down WITH me to look at him, maybe." So he walked in the door and he saw me back there and said, "Yeah, that's my baby brother! Turn him out!" (laughter) So ever since then- Plus I worked a while in <Las Vegas> in the magnesium plant there. I lived in <Las Vegas> and worked at Henderson down there for a while. Then I came back from there and started working at Bellemont, before I went into the service.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, what houses did you live in while you were in the <Flagstaff> area?

GRADY NEAL: First- (tape turned off and on) Then, oh, I got married here in <Flagstaff>, too.

SUSAN ROGERS: What year was that?

GRADY NEAL: In 1940, the same year. We have two daughters by that marriage. Where I first came when I lived here was I rented a little house from a Mexican fellow by the name of Charlie Scoville [phonetic spelling] on San Francisco St.eet. And from there I moved in one of these [bramasiz?] house over in the adobe part of the ______. At that time they were pretty close to the Southwest Mill. And of all of the different places that I lived here. And then I remember the last place I went was Frank.... I can't think of [his last] name, but he used to work at the post office up there. In 1952, I bought this place here, and I've been here ever since.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Now, you said you lived on South San Francisco St.eet for a while.

GRADY NEAL: Yes, I did.

SUSAN ROGERS: Can you describe to me what buildings were there, what kind of reputation the street had at that time?

GRADY NEAL: At that time, all of those buildings down along _________. He had some apartments, and then he had a pool hall down there _____: Charlie Scoville's Pool Hall and he had a bunch of houses around. They extended down Clay Street. Right on the corner of San Francisco and Clay. He’s passed away. They got the business tore down, but they have a ________________. And it wasn't too many houses back from, I'd say, oh.... And they may have even had - the streets weren't even paved all the way down from there, the railroad track down this way. They would come down near to this [ranch area?] nightclub over there. And from there down to the end, it wasn't paved it was dirt. They've added several buildings on the street since I've been there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, then you said you lived over by the sawmill. 

GRADY NEAL: Yes. Has that house been torn down?

GRADY NEAL: That's all torn down. It was built out of adobe. And it was one big red house over there adobe. ____ owned all of that property. ____________. (tape turned off and on)

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, do you want to tell me when and where you were born? Are you a <Flagstaff> native?

HAZEL NEAL: No, I came here when I was six years old.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, then tell me how you ended up here.

HAZEL NEAL: Well, I was born in a little town in <Texas> they call Pineland (?) [phonetic spelling]. I have never been back. My mother and father, I guess, were separated or divorced at an early age, and my father moved to <Flagstaff>. So when I was six years old, he came back to <Texas> and brought me here. My stepmother and he raised me. All that was in 1929. I went to school here, and just grew up here. I don't know whether I have a lot TO tell. I've seen a lot of changes. You know what I mean.

SUSAN ROGERS: Tell me a little bit about some of the changes you've seen.

HAZEL NEAL: Yes. Like I went to school over here at Dunbar - it WAS Dunbar then - Murdock Center. And I went to school and I cooked (?). We had to graduate from the eighth grade then. But at eleven, it was time for me to graduate, but they said I was too young, so I had to stay another year, so I was twelve. And then I went to high school. I did not finish my high school, and I married (chuckles) this man. Then we were married. I had not an interest in life, because I had to stay at home with the children. We had two daughters. One is thirty-four now, and the other one is thirty-three. I guess I can tell you a little something about them, or something else.

SUSAN ROGERS: Sure.

HAZEL NEAL: One lives in <Pasadena> now, and she's a practical nurse. The other one lives in <Phoenix>, and she's an associate professor at ASU. We have been a happy family that’s all I know to say. And there has been some changes in <Flagstaff> because San Francisco St.eet was not quite like it is now. It has always been, oh, the nightclub area, and I guess most people would call it the slum area. It wasn't quite like it is now. It was more of a friendlier place than it is. We thought nothing of San Francisco St.eet [then], but now a lot of us will avoid San Francisco St.eet - you understand. (

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh-huh.)

HAZEL NEAL: I remember when it was just very few black people. Actually, at one time, it wasn't 200. I think THAT population has definitely grown quite a bit - as much as the population PERIOD. We didn't have - everybody knew everybody else. I remember an incident during the time I was going to high school. There was a little house out where the hobby craft shop is on East Santa Fe. I used to walk from there to high school. It doesn't seem like anything now, but it was a LONG ways [then].

Let me see the city hall has moved several times, and the banks and whatnot. I don't know, really, just what you want. Maybe you can insert something.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, why don't you tell me when you first came here, what houses you lived in, and maybe describe the neighborhood a little bit.

HAZEL NEAL: Oh, yes! I lived in a little board house. Southwest had built some - years before that, I guess - had built some houses for their workers to live in. And we lived in a little tiny - I think it was two or three rooms - house.

SUSAN ROGERS: Was this over this way?

HAZEL NEAL: Yes! over in there where- Oh, on Butler Road, I lived there for-

SUSAN ROGERS: And it's not there anymore?

HAZEL NEAL: Oh, no! Southwest has taken it all in. At that time, Southwest was closed, they weren't working for Southwest - we were working for the OTHER mill, over on ALandT, Arizona Timber. Well, that's where he worked at that time.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, when you lived there, how big of a community was that? Did you have running water?

HAZEL NEAL: (laughs) I think we had running water, but I think it was outside. You'd go out to a faucet and get it. I'm SURE it was outside. You'd go out to the faucet and bring it inside. And it was like a community. Since the mill wasn't running, all of the little houses wasn't rented (?) there, so we were lucky enough to move to a bigger house right about where, right over [where] the Coca-Cola plant used to be. It was farther down towards the bridge. You know, going on Butler, you go up there. It was closer to where Babbitts' place is. We lived in a house there, and it was nothing but woods. You know, below the houses, we just walked around in the woods and played. It was just wonderful, we enjoyed it.

But I think at one time, I was rather small - I want to get this right - a friend of ours lived in a big house farther over towards where Southwest is now. I remember it as a huge place with a fireplace in it. I've learned in later years, they said that was the old hospital that they had over in there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, really?

HAZEL NEAL: Now, I don't know whether that's authentic or not.

SUSAN ROGERS: Is that house still there?

HAZEL NEAL: No, all of that's gone. All of that is gone.

SUSAN ROGERS: It could have been there.

HAZEL NEAL: Could very well have been, just like this 'dobe place he's talkin' about he lived. It's all gone, they tore it down.

Up where the Mormon Church is was nothing but just woods up in there. It just went up to that hill there. There were some houses on that hill, you know, where you can see 'em from here. And then it was nothing there. Like up in Old Town, where the flag staff was put when it came. It was ____________ one or two old houses up above that spring, wasn't it? I think it was two, to be exact. And now it has certainly grown.

SUSAN ROGERS: At that time, where did you do most of your shopping? Like, where did your [step]mother do the grocery shopping?

HAZEL NEAL: There was no Food Town, so at Babbitts'. Babbitts' is where they did their grocery shopping, because there's Babbitts' Thriftway on the corner. Not there, not there. All of it used to be in the old store, the main store. And then later, a little before Grady came, it was the Babbitts' Thriftway, where they separated the groceries from the dry goods.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now, were there any little local stores in the community that you lived in that maybe you shopped at?

HAZEL NEAL: Yes, there was this place where he lived, the Scotos, over there, 'cause [his] mother had a store in that building - Charlie Scoto's mother had a store in that building. We kids did a lot of shopping there, and other people did too, but I especially remember it because we were always (chuckles) stealing her candy and whatnot. And the store that's on the corner down there, Mary's Store, is right by the Latin Club, you know, on San Francisco.

GRADY NEAL: Southside Market.

HAZEL NEAL: Well, that's what they call it, Southside Market, but it wasn't then. Her father ran this place. It was a store we would trade in. But at that time there was not a Food Town. I just don't know if- In fact, Babbitts' had a monopoly. There was a Midgley [phonetic spelling] - Midgley had a store.

SUSAN ROGERS: Well, that's in that liquor store is ________.

HAZEL NEAL: That's not Rooks. What is it?

SUSAN ROGERS: The one that's on the corner of Aspen-

HAZEL NEAL: Yes. That’s right.

SUSAN ROGERS: And Beaver, right?

HAZEL NEAL: Andy's. That's where Andy's [is now]. That's where the hot lunches started. Midgley's started fixin' up hot lunches every day, and this is where people would go in and buy the lunch, you know, and take it out. I remember that, definitely.

SUSAN ROGERS: What about entertainment? What did you do for entertainment in town when you were little, or also when you were older?

HAZEL NEAL: Well, we just really had to make our own entertainment, because <Flagstaff> was a slightly prejudiced - was a prejudiced town - at that time. And the black people could not go, like to the Monte Vista and different places. _____ go there. I really don't know- As a little child, I remember this. Maybe my parents didn't WANT to go or something, but the black people could not go everywhere. There was a lot of places that was off limits for black people. But I don't know how long that lasted, but I know after Grady and I got married, we used to go, because we belonged to the American Legion. Not then, you know, after he came back he joined. And we went just about anywhere we wanted to go. But it still was people; they could not go, even in restaurants uptown.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did this ever cause any problems in the time, you remember anything.

HAZEL NEAL: Yes, I remember one time- You remember the black soldier, Grady, that got killed?

GRADY NEAL: (inaudible)

HAZEL NEAL: Yeah that was during the war years. A black soldier was killed by, I think Perry Frances [phonetic spelling], wasn't it? In one of those restaurants there on Santa Fe. I can't remember which one, but he was, he was killed.

SUSAN ROGERS: Because he went into-

HAZEL NEAL: I guess so. I guess that's what it was all about, but he was killed there, the black soldier. I don't remember his name or anything. Maybe- Oh, it was during the war years. I can't remember just what- But I was thinking maybe you could find out about that in the Coconino Sun.

SUSAN ROGERS: Right. Do you know of any other incidents of that sort, maybe when you were a little child, not being able to go anywhere, or do you think <Flagstaff> was fairly decent?

HAZEL NEAL: Well, <Flagstaff> was FAIRLY decent, but we- I don't know, I just don't know HOW the kids did. We just felt happy-go-lucky, because I remember-

SUSAN ROGERS: What about movies? Was there anywhere that you were able to go to movies?

HAZEL NEAL: Yes, but here's the thing there, we had to sit upstairs, we couldn't sit downstairs. After I was married - Grady, you remember - we went to the show for the NAACP to try to break the segregation, and we eventually did. We eventually got so we could sit wherever we wanted to, wherever we could pay for it. But I remember Mr. Riles, wasn't it? (GN inaudible) that had us to go as a trial couple, and the man told us _________. What did we do? Did we come away? And went back-

GRADY NEAL: Talked with him. (inaudible, far from microphone)

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, let's go back to when you went to Dunbar. Can you tell me a little bit maybe about some of the teachers you had maybe how good a school it was something like that?

HAZEL NEAL: Yes. We had one teacher. Mrs. Murdock taught eight grades.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, so it wasn't a very large school then? About how many students, would you say?

HAZEL NEAL: Oh, we had somebody in all those grades. We had eight grades. I can't remember how many. Sometimes it was overflowing. I mean, we had, for the black population, I guess we had about twenty-five to fifty children. You know, what I mean, at a time. But it grew each year. It kept growing each year. And at one time - that's before my time, but Mrs. Murdock used to tell us about it - the Negro children went to school in the basement at Emerson. They couldn’t work with the other kids they went in the basement. I think she was the first teacher of Dunbar. She WAS the first teacher of Dunbar.

SUSAN ROGERS: Can you describe her to me a little bit?

HAZEL NEAL: Yes! I've got a picture of her, too, somewhere.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you?

HAZEL NEAL: I don't know where, I've got to find it. But it is. It's probably in my books. But she was a heavy lady. She was kind of chubby, I'd say. And she was a very fair lady. She was not black as the color black. She was a very GOOD woman. (chuckles) Maybe I'm prejudiced, but I feel like she was good. She carried a lot of weight in <Flagstaff>. If she wanted something done, or some needy family needed something, or whatever she wanted done, she would just call somebody and it would be done. So of course we thought of her as a super being, we really did. She was capable of disciplinary actions. We had some bigger children, boys, that she would tell, "Bend over my lap." (laughs) That doesn't happen nowadays, but that happened then. And oh, I don't know, I guess I'm just ramblin' on, but we had SO much fun, we really did, in Dunbar. _______. I was instrumental in having it made Murdock Center. They wanted to name it something else, and I went before the city council. A lot of the council people, even the mayor at that time, knew her and it was not a problem. That's why its named Murdock Center. They wanted to name it after Mr. Riles, and Mr. Riles, she taught him - not "taught" him, she was very instrumental in helping him.

SUSAN ROGERS: Is this Wilson Riles?

HAZEL NEAL: Yes, it was.

SUSAN ROGERS: Could you tell me who raised him? We're trying to find who we're supposed to interview.

HAZEL NEAL: I know who raised him.

SUSAN ROGERS: Who was that?

HAZEL NEAL: Mrs. Narvia Bryant [phonetic spelling]. She lived right over here on O'Leary.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, how do you spell that name?

HAZEL NEAL: N-A-R-V-I-A

SUSAN ROGERS: Bryant?

HAZEL NEAL: Uh-huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: And she lives on what street?

HAZEL NEAL: On South O'Leary. The number is in the phone book, because she's listed.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, well as long as I know that much, I can get ahold of her, because we knew-

HAZEL NEAL: I don't know whether it's listed as Narvia Bryant, though.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, we have a directory. Do you know her husband's name?

HAZEL NEAL: Leon. He's dead, and I don't know whether she's changed it.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Well, that gives us a good lead, because we knew it wasn't the same last name. Now, did you know Wilson [Riles]?

GRADY NEAL: Yes, very well.

SUSAN ROGERS: Tell me a little bit about him.

HAZEL NEAL: Well, all I can say is good things about him. I mean, I think that when he came here, he was ready for college, first year of college. Well, he just went to college, and he was in just everything he could be in. I mean, he used to dance a lot in college, and he was quite a good student, I understand. I mean, he was kind of older than us, you know, but I remember he came, after he graduated, from college. He taught here at Dunbar. And I think it was under him that other teachers went out to were added. I'm not sure _____ under him, because the classroom had grown so. But I don't know too much about his.... I know THEN about his academic work. You know, how he worked in college, and everybody was crazy about him. But I don't know too much about him, other than that, because he was older than us. I knew him very well, and still we come back and see him. We're very proud of him.

SUSAN ROGERS: Right, right. Okay, at Dunbar, can you remember any special clubs or organizations after school, maybe sports or anything like that?

HAZEL NEAL: For US?

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah.

HAZEL NEAL: No.

SUSAN ROGERS: You didn't go _______. There was no, like, drama club or anything?

HAZEL NEAL: No. When we went to high school, sometimes you got to be into something like that.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, let's move on and talk about the high school a little bit then. Can you tell me maybe outstanding teachers you remember having there, or any special incidents that happened?

HAZEL NEAL: I can remember Mr. McVey, who was the principal, when I went to high school. Mrs. McNerny [phonetic spelling] was the foreign language teacher. She was a special - I really liked her. They said she was a real tough teacher, but I liked her a whole lot. And, well, there was a Mr. Brooksbury [phonetic spelling], English teacher. (laughs) What do you really want to know about?

SUSAN ROGERS: Maybe a little bit about their philosophies in the classroom, how they taught you, how strict they were, how much homework.

HAZEL NEAL: Oh, boy. Mrs. McNerny was terribly strict. She always was on SOME of the boys - ____________ - because they were so playful, that she was always on 'em. But I mean I had a good time with her, because I liked foreign languages - I mean Latin and whatnot - in high school. I got good grades, and that's what she was interested in. I was way out in left field in home ec. I took it because I HAD to take it (laughs), you know what I mean? I couldn't do nothin'! I learned to cook, my mother taught me to cook. Mr. Pulliam, I liked him. He was the math teacher. He taught us. He was a good teacher, but he was a strict teacher. Mr. Brookbury (?) [phonetic spelling] was my English teacher. I didn't know why I didn't like Mr. Brookbury. I got good grades. He was a good teacher, but I just didn't like him. I don't know, I just couldn't generate any interest in his class, just like if he- We had a [Shakespeare]-

[END TAPE 1, SIDE 1; BEGIN TAPE 1, SIDE 2]

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, you were going to tell me about the Fourth of July.

HAZEL NEAL: Okay, they were more the natural Indian. You got to see more of, really, not- I guess because they were primitive. I mean, they would all come not by pickup truck - by wagon. It would take them WEEKS to come from the reservation. And usually our parades consisted of just lots of wagons. And of course the dancers and whatnot. But it was more authentic. You understand what I'm saying?

SUSAN ROGERS: Yes, uh-huh.

HAZEL NEAL: And even with the night ceremonials. They seemed more DEDICATED or something, in doing. The rodeos were, of course- I guess the Indian _______ rodeos. Just, really, they paid them. They _____ still win prizes. But they were more, how do I say, amateurish, than they are now. Now, it's guys that are just professionals.

SUSAN ROGERS: They're commercial.

HAZEL NEAL: Yeah, and whatnot. And I remember they used to, as the wagons would roll by Babbitts' or somewhere, they'd put big sacks of flour in them and different things like that. I remember those things, the down-to-earth common things about it. It was not all those 2 million stands and whatnot, which takes away from the meeting for me, anyway. Everything is so commercial. Our Fourth of July way back then was more interesting.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, since we're talking about the Indians, were there very many Indians that lived in town, do you remember? Or did they all live on the reservation?

HAZEL NEAL: Not many lived in town. The population living in town was very small, as far as I knew. But, gosh, people would come from far and near, just like they do now, when Fourth of July time came, you know, because it was just the authentic, natural Indian - not, "Oh, boy, I'm gonna have a riot because they're not doin' this!" and do all that, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. What about, was there a very big Mexican population when you were growing up, do you remember?

HAZEL NEAL: Yes. Oh, boy! Most of my friends around My house where we lived were Mexicans. You know it's strange, through the years, there's a lot of 'em that still live here, and we still keep in touch with each other. I met one the other day, and I said, "Aren't you Jerry's sister?" She said, "Yes! And aren't you Hazel?" And boy, I haven't seen her in years. So it's interesting, it really is.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember the bootlegging days?

HAZEL NEAL: (laughs) Oh, boy! Yes! I remember those. Down in there where the Indian mission is, right here on.... What is that? _______ street.

SUSAN ROGERS: North of the tracks or on this side?

HAZEL NEAL: On this side, that little mission, right over there close to the railroad track.

SUSAN ROGERS: I don't know offhand.

HAZEL NEAL: Uh-huh, it's not this next street - right on the NEXT street, after this one, up goin' towards town. That street goes that way. It's right down on the end of that street. But what I'm trying to tell you is THEN - probably Mr. Neal can tell you about bootleggin' days too! - THEN that's where some of the bootleggers lived, was down in there. The old lady [who] stayed down there was so calm and easy, but she's the biggest bootlegger in town! (laughs) I guess I'd better not tell you her name. Anyway, it didn't seem to be as much friction and trouble with it, bootleggin'. Most of 'em could get by with it. I don't know whether they were payin' off somebody or not, but they got by with it. But where the trouble was, was with the.... Did you mean the Indian or Prohibition? THOSE days were kinda tough. (laughs) Some guys got rich off the poor Indians. You know what I mean, bootleggin' to the Indians.

SUSAN ROGERS: Any particular episodes that happened?

HAZEL NEAL: I can't remember too much about that, especially way back in bootleggin', because I was little, small [when that happened]. Grady, maybe you can tell her something about bootleggin'.

GRADY NEAL: (inaudible) The Indians then, when they would come to town, they'd be all over, just layin' drunk and whatnot. Of course they had to hide their drinks. They couldn't go into the bars and whatnot and get it, so if they bought a drink from you, just as soon as they got it, just turn it up and drink it-

HAZEL NEAL: Well, they do the same thing now.

GRADY NEAL: - throw the bottle.

HAZEL NEAL: When I'm walkin' around, sometimes there'll be Indians layin' all down behind the place up there.

GRADY NEAL: Well, but they get addicted like everybody. They probably drink ________.

HAZEL NEAL: But I say they're doin' the same thing. Just like on the station grounds up there - Indians, all of a sudden, layin' out there drunk. Some of 'em still try to do it now, wrapped up in them overcoats. That's true!

GRADY NEAL: Yeah not like it used to be.

SUSAN ROGERS: Not so much or something, huh?

HAZEL NEAL: Yeah.

GRADY NEAL: Because they __________ drink ____________.

HAZEL NEAL: Well, they DO, honey!

GRADY NEAL: No they don't. __________ every once in a while they'd get 'em a drink and what not.

HAZEL NEAL: I tell you what, you get up in the mornin' and walk with me. You'll see.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, let me ask you if you can remember any big crimes that happened that maybe stick out in your life as a child or maybe later in the <Flagstaff> area.

HAZEL NEAL: Who was that who killed that man?

GRADY NEAL: (inaudible)

SUSAN ROGERS: Yes you were.

HAZEL NEAL: I can't remember. It was in a new restaurant. I can't remember. I remember him being killed.

SUSAN ROGERS: What little restaurant?

HAZEL NEAL: Oh, it's gone now.

SUSAN ROGERS: So you don't really remember any?

HAZEL NEAL: No, I can't remember any.

SUSAN ROGERS: So far, it sounds like <Flagstaff> was a pretty safe town. No one seems to remember any real crimes.

HAZEL NEAL: There WAS some, but I mean- I don't know, I guess bein' pretty young then, you didn't think about them.

SUSAN ROGERS: None that affected you at all?

HAZEL NEAL: No.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, what about any big fires? Do you remember fires?

HAZEL NEAL: The mill burned down, ALandT.

GRADY NEAL: (inaudible)

HAZEL NEAL: Yes. Well, you tell her about that. I can't remember that.

GRADY NEAL: That's all I know about, just burnin' down. ___________ couple of times since I've been here.

HAZEL NEAL: (inaudible) Can't remember it.

GRADY NEAL: (inaudible)

HAZEL NEAL: Oh, gosh!

GRADY NEAL: _________ service.

HAZEL NEAL: Yes, I was. Where it burned down sixty-year-old houses and-

SUSAN ROGERS: Over here somewhere.

HAZEL NEAL: Uh-huh. I mean, it started at my house. Little boys at the barn, a fire by my house. And it just- I was getting ready to go to church with my two little girls, and I had the clothes layed out and I wasn’t dressed or anything and that's the way I got out, was just with the two little girls in their nightgowns. Just like that!

SUSAN ROGERS: Did your house burn?

HAZEL NEAL: To the ground!

SUSAN ROGERS: It did?

HAZEL NEAL: Everything I owned.

SUSAN ROGERS: What happened? You were taken in by another family, or what?

HAZEL NEAL: My husband's cousin had a little house, and she offered it to me, [in her yard?]. Grady was in the service. But by nightfall the next day, I had more stuff than I had before. You know what I mean? People are SO GOOD! I mean loans, clothes, and everything for me. Yeah. Grady was in the service, so things just kept going as usual. After I let him know about it- He'd been here and had just gone back, wasn't that right?

GRADY NEAL: Yes.

HAZEL NEAL: Uh huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: How long did you have to live somewhere else? Did you get your house rebuilt?

HAZEL NEAL: No, it didn't belong to me, I was renting.

SUSAN ROGERS: What about any big floods? Do you remember any floods of Rio de Flag? (someone enters, tape turned off and on) We were talking about if you remembered any floods.

HAZEL NEAL: Floods? Yes. You know about the recent one we had.

SUSAN ROGERS: No, _________.

HAZEL NEAL: I remember when all the south side __________. People in the lower end of San Francisco St.eet, down here that had - I know one man had to carry his wife. She was expecting. You know the Dorseys? [phonetic spelling]

SUSAN ROGERS: I have an interview with them next Tuesday.

HAZEL NEAL: Mr. Lynn Dorsey is the one that - now, he would be a wealth of information. He was here before I was. But he carried his wife out with their first child. She was expecting their first child, and he had to carry her. He's wading through here.

And one time else that we lived out on the highway out there. One time else in <Flagstaff> that they had a flood that I can remember. We used to have floods quite often, they weren’t BAD you know what I mean. Once or twice we had some pretty good ones.

SUSAN ROGERS: What year was that one flood you were talking about? Do you have an idea?

HAZEL NEAL: I'll tell you what, I bet Mr. Dorsey can tell you. I can't, because I really don't know, but it was way back there.

SUSAN ROGERS: In the thirties, you think maybe?

HAZEL NEAL: Yes, it had to be in the thirties. It was way back there in the thirties.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, I know <Flagstaff> has had lots of snowfalls, big blizzards. Do you [remember] any one in particular?

HAZEL NEAL: Well, let me see. Well, the one you’re talking about 1949. That's the year, boy, it snowed for days. They said this other one was bigger. I remember it so well because we had to try to get out, Grady under a hill over here. Over there we lived down in a little house on hill. And Grady had been discharged with a brace for his neck. One night he was gettin' into bed just (snaps fingers) popped the bone like that, he had had about twenty-seven operations on the leg, trying to save it. _________ twenty inches of bone on one leg trying to save it. So they discharged him with a brace, and it popped, and we had to rush him back to the hospital in San Francisco. So that's where they amputated his leg. I don't imagine he knew. And he's walkin' worse now because he had an accident on it about two years ago. He went hunting in <Arkansas>, and was sitting down in the woods resting his leg, and ____________. And it has really changed the shape. But that's-

SUSAN ROGERS: You were going to tell me about the snowfall.

HAZEL NEAL: Snowfall, snowfall. We had to get him out through there, and we had… the snow was so deep on either side of the road _____ that they dug a path out. You couldn't see anybody walkin' in the road, and THAT was a snow. It snowed for days and days and days. But they say this other one we had in '65 or '67 or something was bigger. That's the year they had to shovel snow off the top of _________________. Are you a native of <Flagstaff>?

SUSAN ROGERS: No, I've lived here six years, though, before lived in <Tucson>. What about any special black organizations in those early days? Was there anything?

HAZEL NEAL: Nothing but NAACP. I don't think they were THAT big back then.

SUSAN ROGERS: But you said later on you and your husband were active in that. Do you want to tell me a little bit about it in the <Flagstaff> community?

HAZEL NEAL: I belonged to the NAACP, and I don't know, I don't think Grady ever joined, but when we went to the- Do you want me to tell you about the NAACP?

SUSAN ROGERS: Sure.

HAZEL NEAL: Well, it was- Mr. Riles, I think, was the president or whatever you call it, at one time. We used to do things like that. We were steadily trying to find out and figure out why we couldn't go - THEY couldn't go to places, I'll put it like that, because Grady and I could go almost anyplace we wanted to go. I guess this is why they would pick us FOR this sort of thing, because we could go and the other people couldn't go, you know, into SOME places. So they'd send us two as the trial couple to these places to see, and then ask them questions, "WHY can't we do so-and-so and so-and-so?" And sometimes we would get some good answers, and sometimes they just wouldn't talk to us about it. And a lot of times we'd just go in someplace and sit at a place and sit down, and they'd come and tell us we had to leave.

Now, in <Palm Springs> I had an experience where it was in a restaurant. <Palm Springs> - Grady was stationed there. He was in the hospital there. There was a little place downtown that you couldn't go to, they said, black people. But this day I walked downtown, I just went in and sat down. I think they didn't TRY to go. I just went in there and sat down. You remember me telling you about that, Grady? They just came and served me, and I was just so happy, sat there and had my cigarette. They were watching, wondering why I was in there - MY people. And I said, "Well, Grady, I believe they just didn't TRY to go in," or something, I don't know.

But the NAACP was more of a force in those days than it is now. You know what I mean? I don't know whether we just don't have the leadership, or what, but THEN, if the NAACP looked into it - and we didn't go with a chip on our shoulder, we went for some ANSWERS - well, it wasn't too long before something was done about this situation.

SUSAN ROGERS: In later years, did any black organizations develop in <Flagstaff> that you remember, like nowadays?

HAZEL NEAL: Still, all I know is NAACP - isn't it?

GRADY NEAL: (inaudible)

HAZEL NEAL: That's all I know. Now, unless the kids have something on campus, I don't know.

SUSAN ROGERS: I haven't heard of anything.

HAZEL NEAL: All I know is the NAACP, and it's NOT too active, in MY estimation.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, Mr. Neal, you want to maybe switch places and let me ask you about the Navajo Army Depot? Okay, do you want to tell me how you ended up working there, or what you did there, and a little bit about it?

GRADY NEAL: When I first got out of service, I went back to all of the places where I had lived here in town before I went in. ___________. So they all turned me down, and said that it was against the law to hire me because I might hurt myself or something. So I felt that there was still something that I could do. By them not giving me anything to do, I picked up a little extra deal of my own and started drinking pretty heavy and thinking I had gone, and _____________ sacrificed my leg to the country. And then to come back to it and couldn't get anything to do which I wanted to try to work and do something. So finally my wife was working for a lawyer here at that time, Lawyer Flint [phonetic spelling]. She told him about the situation ‘cause I guess he knew little about it too. (laughs) But anyway, he talked to the colonel out there at the ordnance depot and afterward wrote me a letter and what not. They finally called me. I had been gone, signing up. When they did call me, they said Mr. Whipple ________. But after he got ___________. _______ ambulance driver over at the hospital, so I went to work __________.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. You said you were an ambulance driver?

GRADY NEAL: Yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: What exactly did you do? Where did you take the people? What kind of injuries?

GRADY NEAL: Oh, well, __________ we had quite a bit of wrecks- the highway, and would be in different hospitals and what not, pick them up, bring them out there, or take 'em from out there back to the <Phoenix> area, the airports in <Winslow>, different places they were going to.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you bring those people, like in Flagstaff Hospital? There wasn't a hospital out there?

GRADY NEAL: Yeah (there was a hospital out there?).

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, you did.

GRADY NEAL: (inaudible) Mostly pick 'em up from Flagstaff Hospital and bring 'em over there. To that hospital ________. _____ different places _____. (inaudible) ________ taxi driver __________ hospital ______ transport ____ taxi _______.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now, when you were working there, did you live in <Flagstaff>, or did you live out there?

GRADY NEAL: Lived here.

SUSAN ROGERS: You lived right here. Okay. Did you have any contact with a lot of the Indians out there? Can you tell me, oh, why they hired so many Indians, and why it was called Navajo Army Depot? Do you know anything about that at all?

GRADY NEAL: Well, I think that it was on Indian land _________. (inaudible)

SUSAN ROGERS: (inaudible)

GRADY NEAL: The only thing they had for Indian village out there. (inaudible)

SUSAN ROGERS: Now, how big a village was that, do you remember? and what it looked like?

GRADY NEAL: There were houses like we have, quarters like. (inaudible) They didn’t have to come to the main hospital. They had ____________ takin' care of that. ___________.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, now, was it families that lived there, or was it just individual men?

GRADY NEAL: Well different families lived there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, I think that just about answers MY questions. Can you think of anything that he's forgotten, or maybe that you've forgotten, or that you want to add?

HAZEL NEAL: The only thing I forgot, is I worked at the ordnance of _____.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, you want to tell me a little bit about that? And apparently you worked somewhere else, too, in town, and I didn't even ask you about your work experiences at all. Tell me a little bit about that. (aside about tape)

HAZEL NEAL: Well, I worked first for Flint. That is how I- I kept telling him how ____. And then when I started working when I- I worked at Ordnance Depot service. Why I guess I didn't stay there and retire is because everytime he was moved somewhere in the States, he wanted me and the kids to come. And so of course I had to quit my job. And my job, had my custodial quarters _______. It was my job to take care of those quarters, which it was very simple, because the married officers would either stay down in married housing, where they had- or they just stayed in town somewhere. (passing train whistle obscures comment) _____ sayin' I had a job, you know. __________. I had one that stayed there years, months, Lt. Mullen. And that's the only one _________. Everytime time I left was because they had moved him to some other hospital. He was in about seven or eight hospitals. I must tell you, that if its alright, how I found out he was hurt. He never told me. He was hurt in the _________. I learned later ______ 450 feet ________ he went down __________. How long did it take them to get you out of there?

GRADY NEAL: I couldn't right fully tell you because ___________.

HAZEL NEAL: You told me you stayed some days down there - a day or something.

GRADY NEAL: (inaudible) _________ that morning. I know about what time. It was around 8:30, I guess. They said it took them sometime late in the afternoon, four or five o'clock.

HAZEL NEAL: Well, anyway, he never wrote and told me about it. At this time there was a Negro paper from back East, The Pittsburgh Courier, and I was sitting reading it. They would ship them out here, and a lot of us would buy them. And I was sitting, reading this paper, and on the page, here's this poor soldier wrapped All AROUND with bandages, his leg up in a sling, his arms. I said, "Oh, my gosh! ________." All you could see was his eyes, you know. Soldier. ________ caption said, "Corporal (?) Grady <Flagstaff AZ>." He had been writing to me, telling me he had malaria fever. He stayed in the hospital practically five years.

SUSAN ROGERS: That’s how you found out.

HAZEL NEAL: That's how I found out!

SUSAN ROGERS: In the paper!

HAZEL NEAL: In the paper. And I don't know what else to say, to tell you.

SUSAN ROGERS: After you worked with the ordnance- was that your last job?

HAZEL NEAL: No, I went to work for a friend, ________ Jackson. We went to school together. They had a son, Douglas that was ill. And she wanted someone to stay with him. And she had asked a girlfriend of mine that she knew, to do this. She had too many jobs. I know these people ___________. And so I took the job, and that's the last job I had. I worked for her for about fourteen years. He was about nine years old, maybe not that old. But he was grown and married, and had retired by then, when I quit in 1966. He just insisted. He retired in 1961, and he'd always said when [he] retired, he didn't want me to work. "I want YOU to retire." And I didn't, I just kept on working until 1966 and said, "This is it, I need for you to quit." And so I hated to, because I liked the job. It was interesting, very interesting. And so that's it.

We're active in the church; I'll say that.

SUSAN ROGERS: What church is that?

HAZEL NEAL: We go to First Baptist on Butler and [Elm?] __________.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Can you tell me a little bit maybe how that church got started? Did you go to that as a child, too?

HAZEL NEAL: Yes, strangely. It was right about where Babbitts' filling station is on Santa Fe. And it was only two houses above. There was nothing above it, but those two houses.

SUSAN ROGERS: They moved it since then.

HAZEL NEAL: Yes, and in the forties I think they moved it over there; they bought this property and moved the church over there. In fact, there's TWO First Baptists here. ___________. We're the first one. But as a child I went to First Baptist Church, and there was not many children in First Baptist Church. Their parents didn't go to Sunday school, so-
