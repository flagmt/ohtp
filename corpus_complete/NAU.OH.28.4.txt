SUSAN ROGERS: This is an interview with John George Babbitt who is currently the chairman of Babbitt Brothers Trading Co. and President and Manager of Babbitt Ranches, Inc. This interview is being conducted on November 21, 1975 at his office, second floor of Babbitts' Department Store, downtown <Flagstaff>. Interviewer is Susan L. Rogers, representing the Flagstaff City Coconino County Public Library.

SUSAN ROGERS: Mr. Babbitt, when and where were you born?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT I was, ah, born in <Flagstaff>, ah, May 19, 1908 in the old tower room of, ah, what later became the, ah, Elks Club and was also called the "mansion house" and which just burned I think in the last four or five years. Um, however, ah, I didn't live there very long. My family moved to, ah, <Los Angeles>, and I only returned in the summer vacation, ah, and ah, therefore, I did miss a lot of the early history of this area when I was away in <Los Angeles>. But, ah, my father was one of the original five Babbitt Brothers. Ah, his name was, ah, Charles Babbitt and more commonly known as C.J. Babbitt. Of the five brothers, ah, Edward Babbitt was the youngest, and, ah, he was out here in <Flagstaff> only a comparatively short time. Although he did serve in the, ah, ah, in the, ah, territorial legislature. But he returned to <Cincinnati> and practiced law. My father was both a merchant and a cattleman. The, ah, primary merchant of the, ah, five brothers was David Babbitt, who was also the oldest. And the other merchant was, ah, George Babbitt. Ah, William Babbitt, ah, widely known as Billy Babbitt, was, ah, one hundred percent cattleman, and he and my father, ah, ran the ranches.

SUSAN ROGERS: Um, when you came here on your summer vacations was the powwow going on at that time or was there any special fourth of July celebrations?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Oh yes. I remember, ah, some of the very early celebrations that used to be conducted, ah, on the field that is now part of the NAU campus, and I remember those very well. It, ah, of course there were road races and once in awhile they'd get an airplane to fly in. They had quite a variety of events. Ah, however, the pow wow as we knew it, up to a couple of years ago, was really the first permanently organized celebration that went on every year as far as I know.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, do you know what year it started?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT No, I really don't, but I imagine it must have been about twenty-five years ago. (the continual use of, ah, and, um, as speech patterns, has been eliminated from the rest of the transcript because it makes it difficult to read for continuity)

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, do you remember your father ever talking about P.J. Brannen? Do you remember him at all?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Ah, no, that was be?

SUSAN ROGERS: Before?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Before my day. But of course I did know of the Brannen family, and my father did own the old Brannen house on let's see, it was on Birch and Park.

SUSAN ROGERS: Is it still standing?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT It's still there. It's a fraternity house now.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh uh huh.

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT And of course my brother married a Brannen girl. In <Los Angeles>. She was of <Los Angeles>, originally from <Tucson>, but, um, I think that she was a niece of P.J. Brannen's.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. How about John Lind? Do you remember any stories?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Of course. John Lind worked for us for many years. I remember him slightly, but there again it's getting back pretty much before my time.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. When your father was a rancher did you ever go on any runs with him or his rounds or whatever he did?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Ah, yes. I used to go out with both my father and also my Uncle Bill. And, I have, very clear remembrances of course of our ranch at what we called Cedar Ranch and out at Lake Mary and various other places.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. What did you do when you went out with them to these ranches?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Oh,really not too terribly much. I was never really what you might call a cowboy. I did enjoy getting out and seeing the cattle and talking with the foreman and getting a general idea of the cattle business.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Did your father also start another business, fur raising or something? Did he have furs?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Oh over the years, Dad was interested in several other outfits. One of them was over at St. Johns or north of St. Johns. A rather small outfit, and at one time he leased our so called Hart Ranch with his own cattle, but later on he sold out his own cattle to the company.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Do you remember what C.J. told you about first arriving in <Flagstaff>? Anything about how big it was or any special stories?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT No the only, the one thing I do remember that he said was that they arrived here in a year that was very mild, and they thought that the <Flagstaff> climate was a very mild climate. It was a couple of years before they found out what kind of winters they could really have here.

SUSAN ROGERS: Right. Ah let's see, and who did your father marry?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT My father and his two brothers, Edward and David married three sisters. They were all Verkamp girls from, of course all of them were from <Cincinnati>.

SUSAN ROGERS: And how many are there in your family? Do you have brothers and sisters?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT In my family?

SUSAN ROGERS: Right.

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Well, several of them have passed on. Presently the only other member of my family that's living now is my brother, Paul Babbitt, who recently retired from the company. Then I also had an older sister, Helen Babbitt, who spent most of her life in <Los Angeles> taking care of my mother, who was a semi-invalid for many years. Then I also had a brother, Jim Babbitt, who was quite prominent in <Arizona> politics and served many years in the, in the state legislature and was very active in a lot of community affairs. Also I had several, or rather another brother and sister who passed away many years ago.

SUSAN ROGERS: What was your parents' child rearing philosophies and what was your daily life like when you were young?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT You mean when I was over here, what was?

SUSAN ROGERS: Ah, you can say both because their philosophies would have been the same, <Flagstaff> or L.A.[<Los Angeles>]

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Well I'm not exactly sure by what you mean by?

SUSAN ROGERS: Were they strict or were they, let you do what you wanted to pretty much?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Oh I was, I was always quite disciplined. Of course coming over here in the summer was a tremendous vacation and something I looked forward to, and we looked forward to hunting and fishing trips and riding horseback, and all those things, and thoroughly enjoyed. And I hated to go back to <Los Angeles> in the fall.

SUSAN ROGERS: Go back to school, huh?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Ah when you came over on the summer vacations, where did you stay usually?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Well ah I guess you might say that most of the time at that house I was telling you about, the so-called "Brannen house", and then also Dad owned the adjoining house which we called the "Charlebois house".

SUSAN ROGERS: Is that one still there, too?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT That's still there, too, yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, any other houses you used to live in in <Flagstaff> before you returned as an adult?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Well, of course, except the old stone castle, the old brick castle mansion house or Elks' Club.

SUSAN ROGERS: And that's burned, right?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT That has burned to the ground.

SUSAN ROGERS: That was like where the library was?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT It is now where the library is.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Um, back to your father just for a moment. Do you remember the opera house they used to run? Do you remember hearing them say any stories about that?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Well I just heard of it, of course, I have no remembrances of it.

SUSAN ROGERS: Right.

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT I do let's see. No, I can't honestly say that I that I do. I can remember when they, our curio department, Indian curio department was situated where our men's shop is, but the opera house at that was before my day.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. When did you get married, and how many children do you have?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Ah I was married in 1933 back east in <Connecticut> when I was living back there in <Wellesley> after I had graduated from business school, and I had two children, Betty and I had two children. Our oldest was, or rather is a daughter. Her name is Dr. Elizabeth Cordasco. She is a child psychiatrist, and then my son, who was killed in a traffic accident, John, Jr.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. And what is your wife's maiden name?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Quimby. Q U I M B Y. She was from <Englewood New Jersey>, right across from <New York City>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Why did you decide to return to <Flagstaff>?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Well I had spent a number of years between going to school and in business back east, and I came back for two reasons. One thing was that the business situation was very tough out here, and they wanted me to come back, and also I yearned for the wide open spaces again.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. What were your impressions of <Flagstaff> when you returned as an adult as to when you had been here as a child? Did it seem like it grew a lot or?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT No, in those days, it didn't seem that <Flagstaff> changed very much. Just in the last, oh, what twenty years or so that large changes have taken place that were particularly noticeable to me.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. And what houses did you live in then when you came back? Are they still standing?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Oh, we, Betty and I lived with Gerturde Babbitt for awhile, who was David Babbitt's daughter. We lived with her for awhile. We lived with my brother and Jim and his wife, Phyllis, for awhile, and then we lived in several houses around town for a short time, but we spent a good many years living in the "Charlebois house" that I mentioned before.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Um, can you remember any big disasters happening in <Flagstaff> like a big flood, or maybe a big blizzard, or a epidemic, or?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT No. I really don't except in comparatively recent years. I remember some terribly tough winters.

SUSAN ROGERS: In recent years, huh?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Yes, and of course I particularly noticed them because of our situation with our cattle.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh and ah. Tell me a little bit more about that. Are you losing cattle, or, I mean?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT We have on occasions lost quite a few cattle. In a very very hard winter, which seems to come about once every twenty years, but over all we've been quite fortunate. We never had a real disaster.

SUSAN ROGERS: Are you in charge of the cattle, too?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: And what do you do in relation to that? Do you go out and look at em or do you just work in this office?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Well I work in the office quite a bit. But I'm still out on the ranch quite a lot.

SUSAN ROGERS: You are huh?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Can you remember how any of the historical events affected <Flagstaff>, maybe, let's see the depression? You'd probably just about arrived back here then.

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT No I had. Well I got back. That was really one of the reasons I guess that I came back. Of course I know that they had, the company had terrible, terribly hard times, and nearly everyone thought that we were going to go completely under for a good many, well for several years. It certainly looked that way.

SUSAN ROGERS: During the thirties?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Mmmm

SUSAN ROGERS: Right. How about the world wars? Did they affect you in any special way?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT No. I wasn't in the service. Possibly one of the main reasons was because of our ranching operations. I was the only one in the outfit at that time who had any knowledge to speak of, of our ranching operation. But of course I remember the trials and tribulations of that period very well.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Do you remember how it affected <Flagstaff> as a whole sort of? Was there a big celebration when the war was over, either war was over or

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT I wasn't here either time when they had peace. But I'm sure that they did a good job of celebrating.

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs) Everybody did, huh.

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT You bet.

SUSAN ROGERS: Let's move into your career a little bit. Ah, you did go to, where did you get your education, your adult education?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Well I went to grammar school and high school in <Los Angeles>. And then I went to the University of Santa Clara up near <San Francisco> for my freshman year, and then I went east to <Washington DC> and attended Georgetown University for two years. Then I came back to <Los Angeles> and graduated from Loyola University in <Los Angeles>. Then I stayed out a year after I got my degree and then I returned back east to Babson Institute where I took a year of business.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. And then you came back here and moved right into the company, right?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT That's right, yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: And what position did you hold when you first came back?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Oh I was just pretty much an office boy. I was an assistant to Mr. Vic Watson, who at that time was in charge of our cattle interests and also pretty much of an overseer the whole situation, and I was with him a great deal of the time. At that time we also had what was known as the Arizona Livestock Loan Co. which made cattle loans to ranchers all over <Arizona> and <New Mexico>.

SUSAN ROGERS: And then how did you move up from there? What other positions?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Well,finally Mr. Watson left the company, and I succeeded the cattle interests.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Can you tell me what you do in a daily work day pretty much here?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Well, I don't, I don't really work anything like as hard as I used to. I'm not really on very much of a schedule. However, I am still interested in the various pursuits of the company. They, between our different enterprises, between the trading post and the ranches and the branches and all that, there seem to be problems coming up all day, and I'm usually in on most of those decisions.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. What would you think of either the company's or your personal failures and successes that you've had over the years?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT The personal which?

SUSAN ROGERS: Ah, failures and successes, either yours or the company's.

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT I see. Ah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Big turning points.

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Well I think that at, of course <Flagstaff> was just kind of rocking along. I think the thing that helped us really tremendously was the ammunition depot out at <Bellemont>. When it was built, it pepped everything up.

SUSAN ROGERS: And when was that about?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Gosh you've got me. It was in the forties.

SUSAN ROGERS: During what, the war sometime?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Yeah, it was right during the war.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Can you think of any other unusual job experiences that you've had?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Oh, not really.

SUSAN ROGERS: Not really? Okay. I read somewhere that you were on the Pow Wow Committee. Were you?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Yes, I was on that for ten or twelve years.

SUSAN ROGERS: Can you tell me a little bit about the pow wow and its development?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Well of course it was started a long time before I was on the board, but as you may know, at that time it was a rather small committee of about a half a dozen local businessmen. And, they put on the pow wow, the rodeo, the Indian dances, and then sometimes we had the big name bands coming in, and we had other dances for the white people. But, it was a very demanding job at that time for the part of the year when it was held. It involved an awful lot of work, and we had quite a comradeship of the committee, and we all worked very hard and ah took great pride in the situation. Of course Tom Knoles is still around <Flagstaff>, and he was really one of the original ones, and was on the committee many, many years and did an awful lot for the committee, and also, although he came on later, Andy Wolf did an awful lot for, and still does for the Pow Wow.

SUSAN ROGERS: Can you tell me about a typical pow wow back then? The Indians coming and and how crowded it was?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Well, of course at that time there were many many Indian wagons. Indians, great percentage of them came in by wagons and at one time, Tommy Knoles and his crew used to feed all the Indians when they were in town, and that was finally dropped. But the attendance by numbers I couldn't give you, but it ran into the thousands, of course.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did they still camp about where they do now, over by the city park?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Yes, of course they, so many of them now have pick-ups and trailers and all that sort of thing. It's not quite like it used to be.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember any special incidents happening over those years with the Indians? Any problems with people in town or anything?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Well there were always some minor problems you know. The Indians drinking then was always somewhat of a problem. But generally speaking I think that <Flagstaff> got along quite well. Better than other cities such as Gallup. And I think we always tried to treat the Indians very well. We went out of our way to do that.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Um, you also were on the Chamber of Commerce?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT I was on the Chamber of Commerce for a number of years, but I really wouldn't be the one to talk to about that. But I was never as active on that as some other people that are still around <Flagstaff>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Can you give me any names? Do you know somebody to contact about the Chamber of Commerce?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Well, of course Ralph Bilby here in our building was active in it. I think my cousin Ted Babbitt was president of it at one time and active in it. Arnold Bledsoe was active in it, and is still around.

SUSAN ROGERS: Let's see. In the Babbitt family are there any special traditions or celebrations that you family have?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT No, we don't really have a big family get together like so many of these other families do. We'll have to probably get into that one of these days. Certainly building up the numbers.

SUSAN ROGERS: Right, right. Let's see. We've covered a lot of things pretty fast it looks like. Can you tell me just a little bit more about the Babbitts' starting here? Like this particular building, how old it was or how they acquired the land right here?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT No I really can't tell you much except this building has been built up. It's about three of four different buildings just kind of put together.

SUSAN ROGERS: Put together. Is the very original one in here? I guess they moved it back or something? Is it still part of this?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT I think this corner down here was probably the original part of it.

SUSAN ROGERS: It still is, huh? Okay.

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT The, one rather interesting thing, from the stand point of our mercantile business, was that in the early days that they used to have trains of wagons coming here from the, oh, from the Payson country. And they would come in, oh I guess, maybe every six months and just load up with groceries. And that was a big event when they came into town. And they stocked up for oh five of six months at a time.

SUSAN ROGERS: Are these the ranchers you mean, coming in?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Yes, the ranchers from down in that area.

SUSAN ROGERS: Um, Dr. Fronske was telling me about all the businesses at that time were more or less delivered delivery services.

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Oh yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: Was that still in the 1930s that way when you came back? You'd go to people's doors?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Oh yes. They used to have door to door delivery for many many years. I remember that of course. The big shopping time used to be Saturday evenings. The stores were open, and it was a great time to visit and and do your shopping.

SUSAN ROGERS: Would people kind of get out and walk around downtown?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: <Flagstaff> then seem friendlier?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Uh Huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: When did that stop?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Oh I couldn't I really can't tell you that. It, but it's been a long time ago, probably, probably forty years ago, fifty years ago.

SUSAN ROGERS: Another thing that Dr. Fronske was telling me about was the water system. Do you remember anything about that? Having a lot of trouble getting water back then?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Oh, you bet. Anyone who lived in <Flagstaff> was always conscious of the terrible shortage of water that we had at times. And I guess he told you about how they used to ship water in by railroad car. And that at one time they, people used to go out to the springs in Ft. Valley and bring in their own water.

SUSAN ROGERS: Mmmm.

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT So it, it was, has always been a problem for <Flagstaff>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Um. You used to come here in the summers. Did you ever go down to <Oak Creek> or?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Oh yes, that was?

SUSAN ROGERS: How'd you get down there? Was that?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT We used to take a couple of wagons and,oh a half a dozen horses. And, as kids we'd get down there and stay for, oh, for a week or even longer, just spend the time down there fishing and swimming.

SUSAN ROGERS: There was a developed road going down there? Or did you have to find your own trail?

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT Oh no, there was a, in my memory there's always been a developed road. It used to be a tough one.

SUSAN ROGERS: (laughs)

JOHN GEORGE BABBITT With lots of switchbacks and all that sort of thing, but?
