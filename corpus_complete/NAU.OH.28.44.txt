[Transcriptionist's note: Lots of background voices and hard surfaces in this location] Interviewer and narrator sound "echoey" and are hard to understand. Loud music starts on Side 2, further complicating audibility. This is an interview with Judge Woo, who is the owner of the Plaza Pizza Parlor, and has been a <Flagstaff> resident since 1924. The interview is being conducted on January 14, 1976, at the Plaza Pizza Parlor in the Plaza Shopping Center. The interviewer is Susan L. Rogers, representing the Flagstaff City-Coconino County Public Library.

SUSAN ROGERS: Judge Woo, when and where were you born?

JUDGE WOO: I was born March 23, 1924, in <Winslow Arizona>. And the folks moved here when I was about six months old, and I've been here ever since.

SUSAN ROGERS: What did your father do? And what caused him to move here?

JUDGE WOO: He was in the restaurant business and came over here to work in a restaurant. He was working in a grocery store in <Winslow>, and came up here [to work in] a restaurant that was located next to the Commercial Hotel there. It belonged to some other people, he was just ___________.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, did he eventually own it?

JUDGE WOO: No, he never did own that one. He did go into partnership with some others, and they opened up another restaurant there just about where the Rose Tree is now. And it was during the Depression and they went broke. And then after that, he rented a house that was- belonged Babbitts, located by Babbitts' Garage. He started doing a little restaurant there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Let's just backtrack a little bit. Do you want to tell me what your mother's name was, or her maiden name and where she came from, and where your father came from?

JUDGE WOO: They both came from Canton China. My dad's name was William K. Woo, and her name was Soo Kum Chee Woo [phonetic spelling].

SUSAN ROGERS: How did they get over to the <United States>?

JUDGE WOO: They came over by steamboat.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did they live in <California> for a while, or did they just move right into <Arizona>?

JUDGE WOO: No, they came - they had some relatives in <Winslow>, so they just came right into <Winslow>, and then they moved over here.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, now, when you first moved to <Flagstaff>, can you tell me a little bit about what houses you lived in, and a little bit about the neighborhoods?

JUDGE WOO: Well, I can't quite recall, because it seemed like to it seemed like to me right next to - there used to be a laundry on the corner there, right across from the Downtowner Motel. There used to be a laundry there, belonged to Wongs, and then they had a house next door to it, and we lived in there.

SUSAN ROGERS: The house is no longer there?

JUDGE WOO: No, it's not there anymore.

SUSAN ROGERS: And you lived there all during your childhood?

JUDGE WOO: As far as I remember, yeah. And then of course we moved from there. There was a restaurant that was next to the Commercial Hotel where my dad was working, and there was a house in the back there, so we stayed there for a while.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now, is THAT one still there?

JUDGE WOO: No.

SUSAN ROGERS: It's gone too?

JUDGE WOO: They are all gone.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, and then after that, where did you move to?

JUDGE WOO: And then we bought a home at 411 West Cherry. We stayed there until all the children were grown up and left. We still own it __________ just as a rental house.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about that neighborhood when you lived in the one you said by the Downtowner? What was it like then?

JUDGE WOO: I can't quite recall. It seemed like there was a laundry on the corner, and then the Nackards lived in the house across the street. And then there was a little hotel behind there. Then there was, seemed like to me there was a little store behind the laundry. And gee, I can't remember too much more.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Did your family used to do most of their shopping down there? Or would they come up to, like Babbitts'?

JUDGE WOO: They'd come up to Babbitts'. There used to be a Babbitts' Store on the corner of Santa Fe and San Francisco, right near where Joe's Place is now. And there used to be Babbitts' Thriftway #3, and they used to do most of their shopping there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Some students on campus have been doing research on South San Francisco, so I usually ask people what they can remember about that particular street. Can you remember anything about its reputation in those days at all?

JUDGE WOO: I can't. No. I remember there used to be a few stores down there. Then a cemetery down below that and that's about all I can remember about it.

SUSAN ROGERS: Tell me a little bit more about that cemetery. Where was it located exactly? Can you remember?

JUDGE WOO: It's- seems like to me you used to be- you'd just go right down to the end of San Francisco Street, and then you came right to it.

SUSAN ROGERS: Was it kind of up on the hill? That's what some people have told me.

JUDGE WOO: No, right now it seems like it's on top of the hill, where they rerouted the road, the entrance. The road that used to go down there, run right through where the stadium is now. So when they built the stadium, they rerouted the road.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, fine. Where did you attend school?

JUDGE WOO: I attended Emerson School, then Flagstaff High School, and then Northern Arizona college, which is NAU now.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh-huh. When you went to Emerson, can you describe a little bit, maybe some teachers that particularly stand out in your mind, or the principal?

JUDGE WOO: Well, the principal there was Mrs. Kinsey. Let's see, I can't recall, I can recall a few of the teachers, but I don't recall the grades. I remember Mr. [Redman?]. Used to be a fellow by the name of Mr. [Dickerson?]. And then I think when I was in sixth grade there; we had a fellow by the name of Dockstader [phonetic spelling]. I can't remember any more.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about, like the discipline in the class, and do you think it was fair, too strict? Did you have homework then?

JUDGE WOO: Well, I think it was much stricter than they are today, 'cause I remember usually we used to have the area roped off that whenever there was snow, and during recess, they would allow us to throw snowballs over by the River de Flag. And sometimes kids would be runnin' on the other side and they'd be throwin' on the other side, and then the principal would come out and get 'em, and she would take them to her office, and she would discipline with a paddle.

SUSAN ROGERS: That was okay with the parents at that time?

JUDGE WOO: At that time, evidently it was all right. I imagine they'd probably do the same thing at home.

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah, right. Okay, do you remember any special extracurricular activities at Emerson? Were there any sports or drama or anything like that?

JUDGE WOO: No, there wasn't anything. They didn't have anything like that. At that time, the grade schools didn't even have teams for sports or anything like that. I don't think they have any here, actually organized sports until you got into high school.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, so from there you went up to Flag High School?

JUDGE WOO: Flag High School.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, can you tell me a little bit about that school? Maybe any outstanding teacher that you remember, a little bit about that?

JUDGE WOO: There were quite a few. There was, let's see, at the time up the- there- the ah- the principal up there was John Q. Thomas. And then let’s see some more of the teachers up there was Mr. Pullen [phonetic spelling] was up there at the time. Mr. Brooksby, Ms. McNary [phonetic spelling]. Mr. Micke [phonetic spelling]. Mr. Micke taught physics. Then there used to be an English teacher up there by [Mares?]. And then Mrs. McGinley [phonetic spelling] used to be the librarian. Mr. Wheeler was the coach.

SUSAN ROGERS: Is that Rollin? [phonetic spelling]

JUDGE WOO: Rollin Wheeler was the coach up there. And he taught history and physical education. And then Mr. Killip was teaching shop. I can't remember anymore.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, how about- Were you going to say something?

JUDGE WOO: Oh, the janitor up there was a gentleman by the name of Vic Thompson, everybody seemed to like him quite well. He was quite popular with the kids.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, what about some of the extracurricular activities up there? What do you remember?

JUDGE WOO: Well, about the only thing I remember was going out for football or basketball or something like that. At that time they didn't have any baseball - it was either football or basketball. And then I think they had intramural between the different grades ___________.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, there weren't any extra clubs, like maybe drama or anything like that?

JUDGE WOO: I don’t quite remember, there was a camera club. I think there was a camera club, ____________. I believe there was a hiking club, too.

SUSAN ROGERS: How did you feel about the discipline up there? _______.

JUDGE WOO: It was quite accurate.

SUSAN ROGERS: You don't have any complaints or anything?

JUDGE WOO: I don't think so.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. You said from there you went to NAU, right?

JUDGE WOO: No, I went in the service. I was in the service.

SUSAN ROGERS: And where were you stationed then?

JUDGE WOO: I went in the service, I moved to <Amarillo Texas>, and I took basic there. Then from there I went up to <Denver Colorado>. And from <Denver Colorado>, I went to <Stillwater Oklahoma>. Then from <Oklahoma> I went to <North Carolina>. And from <North Carolina> to <Georgia> and then <Georgia> to <Florida> and then overseas to <India>.

SUSAN ROGERS: To <India>?

JUDGE WOO: Yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: And how long were you there?

JUDGE WOO: I was over there about a year-and-a-half, until the war ended.

SUSAN ROGERS: You went to a lot of places!

JUDGE WOO: Quite a few places.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, now when you came back, did you go up to NAU?

JUDGE WOO: No, after I came back, Dad had a restaurant down here on 115 east Aspen, next to the Monte Vista there. So I worked with him down there about ten years. And then I went back to school in '52. I was in school in '52, and got my degree in '55.

SUSAN ROGERS: What did you get your degree in?

JUDGE WOO: In accounting.

SUSAN ROGERS: And then is that when you acquired this place?

JUDGE WOO: No. I was in the accounting business for a while, by myself. And then I had another place down on South Santa Fe, Stein Club. It's Boso’s [phonetic spelling] now. I had that for about eight or nine years, and then I moved up here in 1965. Opened up this, oh what was it, December 15, I believe it was 1965. I’ve been here since then.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay that gave us a quick sketch up to the present, now we'll backtrack. I didn't ask you how many brothers and sisters you had, and what their names were, and where they were now.

JUDGE WOO: Well, I had two brothers and three sisters. Jacurry [phonetic spelling] was a brother about a year younger than I am, and he's in <California>, and he's working for the North American Aircraft (?).

SUSAN ROGERS: Want me to turn this off?

JUDGE WOO: He's been with them ever since he's been out of the service. And then my younger brother, he's in <Phoenix>, working for the Employment Security Commission.

SUSAN ROGERS: What's his name?

JUDGE WOO: Jersey Woo [phonetic spelling]. And then my older sister, Jessie, she's married, raised a family, and they have a grocery store in <Buckeye Arizona>.

SUSAN ROGERS: What's her married name now?

JUDGE WOO: Mrs. Eng, E N-G, __________. And then my other sister lives in <Phoenix>. Her name is Toy, and she's raising a family there, and she's teaching school. And a younger sister is in <Tucson>. She's married and her name is Quinn [phonetic spelling]. She's teaching part-time.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, fine. Okay, when you were a child, do you remember any special celebrations that <Flagstaff> had particularly probably the Pow Wow or something?

JUDGE WOO: Yes, uh-huh. The annual Pow Wow was a common thing at that time. And then the American Legion used to sponsor auto races. That’s all, those two events ________.

SUSAN ROGERS: Where were these auto races held?

JUDGE WOO: They were held at the City Park.

SUSAN ROGERS: Were they held on the Fourth of July, you mean, or different times?

JUDGE WOO: No, they were different times. The Pow Wow had always been on the Fourth. But the auto races, I don't know whether they preceded it or after. But they used to run it for annual.... Once in a while they'd have boat races out at Lake Mary. But I don't think the boat races were an annual affair. That's most of the activities I can remember.

SUSAN ROGERS: About how long did those auto races go?

JUDGE WOO: They'd usually last a couple of days on the weekends - Saturday and Sunday of some weekends.

SUSAN ROGERS: How many people attended? Would it be a big function, most of <Flagstaff>?

JUDGE WOO: It WOULD be a big function. They'd have a good turnout. They usually had maybe, oh, eighteen, twenty cars entered.

SUSAN ROGERS: Was this back in the thirties or the forties?

JUDGE WOO: This was in the late thirties and forties.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, what can you tell me about Prohibition? You said that you lost your store. Can you tell me a little bit about ______?

JUDGE WOO: It was during the Depression, back in the thirties.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, fine, that's what I meant, the Depression.

JUDGE WOO: Well, this restaurant that they had, I think there was about three or four partners in it, and then they just went under. They just couldn't pay their bills, and they just closed it up. And then my dad went down, and found this vacant house that was on Highway 66 at that time, which is Santa Fe Avenue. And he converted it over and made a little restaurant out of it. It wasn't very big, all he had was two tables, and I think he had a little counter. He built a little counter and he had four or five stools. And then he stayed there until Babbitt had the - was going to tear the house down. And then he went over on Aspen.

SUSAN ROGERS: Can you tell me the name of the one that was torn down?

JUDGE WOO: He called it The Greenhouse Café. It was a green house; it was painted green, so he called it The Greenhouse Café. And then he went over on East Aspen, and he opened up this restaurant there, and he called it William's Café. That was his first name, William, so he called it William's Café. And then after the war, he remodeled and called it Woo's Café. And he stayed there until about, oh, I guess 1955, '56, and then he closed it out and converted it into offices.

SUSAN ROGERS: Probably that building is still down there?

JUDGE WOO: Yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: Offices still?

JUDGE WOO: Uh-huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, fine. Do you remember the bootlegging that went on in <Flagstaff> at all?

JUDGE WOO: Just vaguely, because I remember I was a kid. We used to go along this highway along the railroad tracks, carting these little flasks. I don't know, there used to be a fellah, I think he was either on West Birch, West Aspen, anyway all I remember is they would call him "Big Red". And they used to give us two cents a bottle, and then if we found those gallon bottles, he used to give us some nickels. So we used to go out and collect those and turn them in.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you know what you were doing that for?

JUDGE WOO: No, we didn't. He was buyin' bottles, and we were lookin' for bottles to sell. That's all.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. That's about all you remember?

JUDGE WOO: That's about all I can remember.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, as a child, can you tell me what some of your daily activities were maybe in the summertime, what you did in the <Flagstaff> area for entertainment?

JUDGE WOO: There wasn't too much. There wasn't too much. We used to either go for bike rides, or else used to - I think the city sponsored these baseball teams. Actually they weren’t baseball teams, they’d provide you with the bats and balls if you want to come out and play, and that was it. We used to go out and play a little ball.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, where did you play the ball, was it like up on _____?

JUDGE WOO: On the playgrounds of Emerson School.

SUSAN ROGERS: How about in the wintertime? Any special winter activities?

JUDGE WOO: There wasn't anything.

SUSAN ROGERS: There wasn't anything besides ordinary sledding.

JUDGE WOO: _________ pool hall.

SUSAN ROGERS: Pool hall?

JUDGE WOO: Yeah, there used to be, under the Weatherford Hotel - we used to call that the Gopher Hole, and a fellow by the name of Sandy McKeefe [phonetic spelling] had it, and he had four or five pool tables down there, we used to go down and play pool.

SUSAN ROGERS: That's just as kids, quite young?

JUDGE WOO: Yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: And you were allowed to go into the pool halls?

JUDGE WOO: Yes. Outside of that, there used to be one bowling alley under the Masonic building, and they had a couple of pool tables in there, and four alleys.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, what about movies? Did you attend any movies?

JUDGE WOO: There used to be three theaters downtown there: the Orpheum and there used to be a Liberty Theater just about - it was on Leroux Street. That building's already been torn down. It was right next to the City Hall. Used to be a City Hall there. And the Liberty Theater was there. And then there used to be a Flagstaff Theater. It was on San Francisco Street, across the street from Fine's.

SUSAN ROGERS: Where Karl's Shoe Store is?

JUDGE WOO: Just about next door to Karl's Shoe Store. Karl's Shoe Store used to be a bar in there. Used to be Black's Bar. Then right next door was the Flagstaff Theater.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. What types of movies came in?

JUDGE WOO: Usually mostly westerns, mysteries.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember any famous people coming through? I understand that quite a few movie stars came on location.

JUDGE WOO: Yes, William Boyd, Hop-along Cassidy was by one time. And I remember I think he was filming out at Bald (?) Creek. And then later on I remember, I believe made two, three movies down there. Can't remember who the other stars were. I believe one time Ava Gardner was there. And Andy Devine was here. But outside of those- I'm sure there was more.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember seeing them around town at all?

JUDGE WOO: I remember seeing this William Boyd, Hop-along Cassidy. I remember seeing Andy Devine.

SUSAN ROGERS: Where did you see them?

JUDGE WOO: Down at the Monte Vista Hotel.

SUSAN ROGERS: Tell me a little bit about the Monte Vista.

JUDGE WOO: Well, the Monte Vista used to be the meeting place for all your clubs and any - it was about the best hotel in town, at that time. And usually when these celebrities come to town that’s where they would stay. So they'd come there and stay there, and people hear about it. They always mill around the foyer, lookin' in the coffee shop or somethin', to try to see 'em.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Do you remember any big social events that happened at any time - maybe at the Monte Vista or something? Any big annual social balls or anything like that, that you remember?

JUDGE WOO: No, because I never attended any of 'em, so I really don't know of any.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. I was going to ask you who some of your childhood friends were, but you said like the Nackards lived there.

JUDGE WOO: Nackards, we played with the Nackards. There used to be Gullis (?) boys, Tony and James [Gullis?]. I played with them. And then Mark Vandervier's boy, would be Tom Vandervier. Art (?) Vandervier used to be the sheriff, later, ____________. Jim Babbitt, Ole Solberg, there??s others, but they've long moved out.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, do you remember any big fires?

JUDGE WOO: The only big fire I remember is the mill that burned down. I don't remember the year. You could see it from the street down Santa Fe there. I forget what year it was. I know I was just a kid, still goin' to high school. I was workin' at a service station there on the corner of Verde and Santa Fe. You could look out across there and-

SUSAN ROGERS: Saw smoke coming? Okay, do you remember any floods?

JUDGE WOO: One time - I can't recall the year - but the River de Flag had flooded and I remember water coming up to just about where the Orpheum Theater was. It flooded on the south side there, too. I remember the water coming down there, and the River de Flag, we used to walk along the banks of it, and we’d make those spears and spear things as they come down.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Now, when it flooded like that, like to the Orpheum Theater on the south side, what did people have to do? What inconveniences?

JUDGE WOO: Well, I believe they blocked the streets so you couldn't get by. Whether the houses were flooded or not I really don't know. I imagine some of them were flooded, but most of 'em were built quite a bit higher than the street right in that area - some of 'em, not all of 'em.

SUSAN ROGERS: I know there were lots of big snowfalls. Do you remember any one in particular that stands out?

JUDGE WOO: Well, I can't remember the year. It seems like it was right around '48, '49. I remember that, and that seemed to be the one that sticks in my mind most, but I don't know whether that was bigger than the one in '67 or not. But I think that appeared to be more then, because I think our snow removal wasn't as good as it is now.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about how that affected the community?

JUDGE WOO: Well, a lot of stores just closed down. They couldn't get supplies in. I remember they couldn't get supplies in. Some of the stores just closed down. And then eventually I guess they got the supplies in and they opened up again. But there were quite a few stores that ran out of merchandise _________.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, do you remember there being a shortage of water in <Flagstaff> ______ problem?

JUDGE WOO: Yes. I remember they used to haul water in the tank cars. They used to put it out on a siding right there on Santa Fe and Verde, I guess it is. It was in that area there. And I remember we used to have to take buckets and go up there. If you wanted water, you had to go up there and take a container and fill it up.

SUSAN ROGERS: Was it quite a line to stand in?

JUDGE WOO: At times no. At times, there was.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you have to pay for it?

JUDGE WOO: I don't remember paying for it. I just remember going over and getting it and taking it home. Whether they paid for it or not, I don't know.

SUSAN ROGERS: Let me flip this over.

[END TAPE 1, SIDE 1; BEGIN TAPE 1, SIDE 2]

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, since your father owned restaurants, did you work there?

JUDGE WOO: I worked there, yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: Tell me something maybe about the tourists that came through - where they were from, what they were seeing, that type of thing.

JUDGE WOO: Well, it seemed like to me that most of the tourists that were coming through at that time, they were all going to the <Grand Canyon>. Pretty near everyone that came through, they were all from back east, from every state of the union. But it always was they were going to <Grand Canyon> or going to <California>. I remember a lot of these bad dust storms like in <Oklahoma>. There used to be a lot of _______ from <Oklahoma> going through. I remember seeing them quite frequently (?). And they’d be driving these old trucks, cars, and they'd be just loaded down with everything - mattresses, and everything thrown on top. Sometimes two feet. Most of those were going to <California>. They were all trying to make <California>.

SUSAN ROGERS: Where would those people stay in <Flagstaff>? Did they camp?

JUDGE WOO: I don't think that they would stay. I think they would probably just camp and then go on - camp alongside the road and go on their way.

SUSAN ROGERS: Would you say that your father's restaurants catered more to the tourists, or was there a local ____________?

JUDGE WOO: No, I think the clientele that he had was mostly Indians.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh!

JUDGE WOO: I would say about ninety percent would be Indian trade, and the other might be tourists. (background music starts)

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. You said with the Indians- did they come in from the reservation, the ones you talked about, or Indians that lived in town?

JUDGE WOO: No, at that time the Indians that he would do business with would be - I guess you might say they was hawkin (?) or from the town, to hawk _____ reservation.

SUSAN ROGERS: Just like, how they come in on Saturdays, or something?

JUDGE WOO: Right, uh-huh, sometimes come in two, three times a week.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember any particular problems that the community had with the Indians at all?

JUDGE WOO: Well, I think the biggest problem that they had at that time was that they weren't allowed to have liquor. They would come into town, and they couldn't buy liquor at the stores, so they had bootleggers, they would buy it from the bootleggers. And then what they would do, as soon as they got their bottle, then they went out someplace, then they would drink it all at once. They'd get quite drunk and then I think that was probably the biggest problem they had. Outside of that I don't think they had much problems.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, what kind of food did the restaurant specialize in?

JUDGE WOO: Oh, mostly steaks, hamburgers, and stew. They went in for stew quite a bit - mutton stew. They went in for the mutton stew quite a bit, and the regular beef stew.

SUSAN ROGERS: While you were growing up, do you remember any particular crimes in <Flagstaff>? Even if when you were older you remember something that sticks out.

JUDGE WOO: Uh, actually the one that I remember, that kind of sticks in my mind, I don't know who they were, but these people had lived out on the Fort Valley Road, and the whole family of 'em. I don't know if [they was despondent?] or what it was, but the father had killed the family (?). I don't know whether he shot 'em, or whether- Seems like to me that they said there was someone shot ____________. I don't think they were shot. It might have been-

SUSAN ROGERS: About what year was this?

JUDGE WOO: Oh, this was about in the forties (?).

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember the name?

JUDGE WOO: I don't remember the name, but I remember ____________ everything up this way would be Fort Valley Road. It's just I don't know _________.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, do you remember any other particular ones.

JUDGE WOO: I'm sure there were quite a few, but I just can't recall any (?).

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Now, when you were young, did you ever take a trip down to <Oak Creek>? Tell me about it all.

JUDGE WOO: Once in a while we went down there. There wasn't anybody that had transportation in those days. We'd go down there, I don't think, more than maybe once or twice a year, 'cause the means of transportation _________.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you used to go with friends?

JUDGE WOO: Yes. ____________ at that time we didn't own an automobile.

SUSAN ROGERS: What about, did you make any trips to <Grand Canyon> in those days?

JUDGE WOO: No. As a matter of fact, I lived here all that time, and never did go to the <Grand Canyon>. The first time I ever saw the <Grand Canyon> was after the war.

SUSAN ROGERS: That's quite common. Quite a few people haven't been up there. Okay, what about the Peaks? Did you ever go up on that old Weatherford Road?

JUDGE WOO: I've heard about it, but I've never been up on it. I've been around it, all around the area, but I never went up on the Weatherford Road to the top.

SUSAN ROGERS: You never paid the toll to go on it at all?

JUDGE WOO: No.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, when you were growing up, was there quite a large Chinese community?

JUDGE WOO: No, as a matter of fact, when I was growing up, there was just the two families: the Wongs and Woos.

SUSAN ROGERS: That was all?

JUDGE WOO: That was all.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did more families come in later on?

JUDGE WOO: Then after the war, the other families moved in.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, now, was there any certain reason why they moved in? Or did they all move in separately?

JUDGE WOO: They just moved in separately, going into business.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you used to have any special get-togethers with the other Chinese family? I was going to ask if there were any Chinese organizations, but with only two families, there probably wouldn't be.

JUDGE WOO: Organizations, no. We'd get together once in a while, maybe Chinese New Year or something like that, and have a dinner.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you have any problems with the Mexicans or the blacks at all? Were there very many blacks around?

JUDGE WOO: There were quite a few blacks. Quite a few blacks and Mexicans all on the south side. I never had too much problem.

SUSAN ROGERS: You don't remember any incidents?

JUDGE WOO: No. I know at school there used to be a lot of fights between the Mexicans and the whites. But I personally never did have any trouble with 'em.

SUSAN ROGERS: Back to the schools, did you ever have any problems with the parochial kids? Was there any kind of competition between Emerson and the Catholic school at all?

JUDGE WOO: Usually, it seemed like in sports. The only thing in sports, it seems like we did football. I remember what they would do, get a bunch of kids from Emerson School and play the kids at the Catholic school, or at the training school. There used to be a training school down there. The college used to have a training school. I don't know how high the grades went at that training school, but I remember some of the kids going down there to play.

SUSAN ROGERS: [Going] there and playing, okay. You said that you went to NAU in the 1950s. I think at that time it was Arizona State College, right?

JUDGE WOO: Arizona State college, yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, do you want to tell me a little bit about maybe your college days there?

JUDGE WOO: Well, the enrollment, when I was there, would never run over 500. As a matter of fact, the year that I graduated, I think the enrollment was 470 or something. Most of the classes were in Old Main, and then a few of the science classes over in the old Science Building.

SUSAN ROGERS: This was even in the fifties, huh?

JUDGE WOO: Oh, yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

JUDGE WOO: This was '52 to '55. On top of that, I had a couple of classes in - there used to be some barracks right behind Old Main, and they brought those in right after the war, to make classrooms out of them. And they used to have classes in those. But most of the classes were in Old Main.

SUSAN ROGERS: They still were at that time. Do you know when Old Main became a dormitory? Must have been fairly recent.

JUDGE WOO: Must have been in the middle sixties.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Do you remember any outstanding teachers there that you had?

JUDGE WOO: Well, there's, let's see, Dr. Bellwood, John Briel, and then, let me see- an economics teacher by the name of Fredricks (?). Dr. Ardrey, Dr. Allen. Let's see Mr. Burke [phonetic spelling] taught shop. Derifeld was _____ here. The librarian was- Huh. She was up here for years and years. Can't think of the name right now.

SUSAN ROGERS: Can you describe the library to me, what it looked like?

JUDGE WOO: Well, the library was, uh, I believe the offices were down below, and the library was upstairs. Had to go upstairs and then a great big room with a bunch of tables in it, and books just stacks.

SUSAN ROGERS: What kind of discipline was there in the library in those days? Were you allowed to talk, or was it real quiet?

JUDGE WOO: The name was Rogsdale, Rossdale.

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah. I remember that name. Mrs. (sic) Regsdale was that name.

JUDGE WOO: She was quite strict. She wouldn't put up with any noise at all.

SUSAN ROGERS: So it wasn't like a social gathering like it is now?

JUDGE WOO: No uh, uh. If you couldn't be quiet, she asked you to leave. She was quite strict.

SUSAN ROGERS: What did you feel about in the classrooms? Did you feel that you received the right amount of homework? Or a little bit about the philosophy of teacher’s maybe, or something?

JUDGE WOO: I think at that time the teachers were - well, I guess you might say personal. You seemed to have more personal contacts with 'em. The classes weren't too big. I had several classes there - well; we had just four or five in the classroom. And then a lot of times we'd get in there and start talkin', it seemed like the students' favorite topic was to get the teacher off on a tangent so he wouldn't be talking about something else. They used to do that quite often. Start talking to him and then get off on, maybe in accounting class, maybe telling about something back in <New York>, or something.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. What was I going to ask? What about any special events on campus?

JUDGE WOO: Well, we used to, uh- homecoming. We had Mom and Dad’s Day too. And then at the end of the school year they used to have these picnics. Each class would have their picnics.

SUSAN ROGERS: Where would these be held?

JUDGE WOO: Most of 'em were down in <Oak Creek>. They would ditch that day and go down to <Oak Creek> and have [a picnic].

SUSAN ROGERS: Can you tell me a little bit about homecoming in those days?

JUDGE WOO: Well, homecoming in those days, they would select the themes, too, like _________. They would have a bonfire the night before the game, and then they would have this parade. They'd usually have a rally and this rally, they used to come up on Beaver, and then they'd go down on Santa Fe and go around the block and then go back to campus. And then the homecoming parade, they used to start off on South Sitgreaves, then down on Santa Fe, and they used to come over to, I believe it was San Francisco. Then they would go up on San Francisco to Aspen. From Aspen they'd go back down to Sitgreaves and then they'd disband there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, now, did the community enter into this quite a bit?

JUDGE WOO: Quite a few businesses would enter floats. And then they would have judging on it, and prizes for your different floats.

SUSAN ROGERS: And then, like, did the community come out and watch the parade? Was there quite a large crowd?

JUDGE WOO: It was quite a large crowd, yes. They would block off the streets for the parade. I guess the parade would last about an hour.

SUSAN ROGERS: What about any special clubs and organizations? Do you remember anything in particular?

JUDGE WOO: Well, there were fraternities on the campus then, and sororities. And then the Lettermen Club was there. And they used to have the Blue Key.

SUSAN ROGERS: About how many fraternities and sororities?

JUDGE WOO: There were two fraternities.

SUSAN ROGERS: Where were they located, on campus or off?

JUDGE WOO: Well, they were on campus. There were no buildings like that, it was just a group of fellows that _________.

SUSAN ROGERS: What about sororities?

JUDGE WOO: There were some sororities. I remember the Spurs. I'm sure there's some others, but I wouldn't know the names of 'em.

SUSAN ROGERS: I don't know how much you participated in the events since you were a little bit older. Do you know where the students would gather to drink their coffee and get together and talk?

JUDGE WOO: It would be the student union. The student union was there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did they used to ever have big fires around that fireplace that's up there in the old student union?

JUDGE WOO: I remember seeing a fire.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember where the students would gather in town? What did they do on a normal basis, on a date maybe or something?

JUDGE WOO: There weren’t too many places.

SUSAN ROGERS: And the soda shops, anything like that? ________.

JUDGE WOO: There weren't too many places _________. I remember there used to be ____ on North Leroux. _______, block, they used to call it the Candy Box, and some of 'em went there. And then there used to be _______ the Greyhound depot used to be in the downtown area, next to the Pine Hotel, and they had a coffee shop in there, and there were quite a few who used to go in there. And the old Patio had a restaurant up on the main street. Quite a few used to go in there. _____________.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember any of the rules and regulations on campus maybe? Dress codes or-

JUDGE WOO: I don't think there was any dress code.

SUSAN ROGERS: How about hours that women had to be in?

JUDGE WOO: The girls had to be in at eleven. And then there wasn’t any hours on the boys. And then I think the girls used to, on the weekends, they were allowed out until one - then they had to be in at one. Then there was just the one dorm, on this North Hall. That's the only dorm there ___________.

SUSAN ROGERS: Anything else you want to add on NAU at all?

JUDGE WOO: (inaudible)

SUSAN ROGERS: I want to ask you about your own marriage and children. How'd you meet your wife, and how many kids do you have?

JUDGE WOO: Well, I met her- she was one of my employees one time. I married her, and then we raised three girls and one boy.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, can I just get their names?

JUDGE WOO: The oldest boy is Jeffrey. The oldest girl is Susan. Next to the oldest is Nicole. And the youngest one is Stacy.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, fine. I think you pretty well answered my questions. Can you think of anything? Any personalities you remember around town, either because they were rough characters, or because they were prominent in the community, that you can give any character sketches on?

JUDGE WOO: No, I can’t account ______.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. No special names stand out?

JUDGE WOO: (inaudible)

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Can you think of anything else you want to add at all?

JUDGE WOO: I can’t think of anything.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, fine.
