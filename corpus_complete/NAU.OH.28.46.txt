JOHN ALLEN: John Allen 



LOLA ALLEN: Lola Allen 



This is an interview with John and Lola Allen who have lived in <Flagstaff> continuously since 1945. Both have taught in Flagstaff public schools. The interview is being conducted on June 25th, 1976 at the Allen's home at 603 W. Grand Canyon Avenue in <Flagstaff> by Kristine Prennace, representing the Flagstaff City Coconino County Public Library. Linda <Williams> and Nancy Warden transcribed interview, October 31th, 1994. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: We can start with Mr. Allen. Where were you born? 



JOHN ALLEN: In <Missouri>. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh. 



JOHN ALLEN: You want the name of the town? 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Sure. 



JOHN ALLEN: <Kidder Missouri>. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Kiddress? 



JOHN ALLEN: Kidder. K i d d e r 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Where were you born, Mrs. Allen? 



LOLA ALLEN: <Plano Illinois>, P l a n o. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: And, when did you come to <Flagstaff>? Well, when did you come to <Arizona>? 



JOHN ALLEN: I came to <Arizona> in 1912 about two months after statehood. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: And why did you come at that time? 



JOHN ALLEN: Well, I came to practice law in the state of <Arizona>. Came to <St. Johns>. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: So you were an attorney for awhile? 



JOHN ALLEN: Yes. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: And when did you come? 



LOLA ALLEN: 1925. I came rather as an adventure to teach school, way away from home. I met him. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What part did you settle in first? 



LOLA ALLEN: West of <Buckeye>, <Palo Verde>. That's where I went to teach. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Maybe you can talk a little bit about those areas when you first came. I'm sure that they were quite different than they are now. You want to talk about <St. Johns> area? 



JOHN ALLEN: Well, it was a very peaceful little Mormon town, and there wasn't very much opportunity for the legal work, so I went into teaching. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you teach high school there? 



JOHN ALLEN: No. I began in a very small school at <Concho>, a Mexican school. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you have any problems communicating with the people? 



JOHN ALLEN: No. Not much. They were very cooperating. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: About how many students did you teach the first few years? 



JOHN ALLEN: About twenty-five. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: And they were all grades? 



JOHN ALLEN: Yes, all grades. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did they speak mostly Spanish at first? 



JOHN ALLEN: On the playground, Spanish. In the schoolroom, English. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: They could understand you? 



JOHN ALLEN: Oh, yes. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: And what was <Palo Verde> like? 



LOLA ALLEN: Well, he can tell more that because he was there before I was. I was there a couple of years, but he knows all about that valley, too. 



JOHN ALLEN: It was a farming community, mostly dairy farming at that time, and cotton raising. There were plenty of Southern people that migrated in there to raise cotton. It was a country community. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Very small. 



JOHN ALLEN: Yes. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was it still the one room school type? 



JOHN ALLEN: No. Three, four rooms. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: So there was a little breakdown of the grades. Well, then, Mrs. Allen, you went in 1925, and you just started teaching right then? 



LOLA ALLEN: Yes. I went out there to accept a position in his school. My sister was there, that was what had got me started. She said there was a vacancy, maybe I'd like to come. And, I did. Expected to go back to <Michigan>. I even got my job back in <Michigan> when he stopped me. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: A little romance. 



LOLA ALLEN: I never wanted to go back to live. We've gone back to visit. We used to. We haven't been back for a long time. But we used to go back to get out of the summer heat down in the <Salt River Valley>. Now we're up here, and this is the nicest place to be in the summertime. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: So, how long did you teach in <Palo Verde>? 



LOLA ALLEN: Two years. 



JOHN ALLEN: I taught six years there, before World War I and after. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What kind of effect did the World War have on the area? 



JOHN ALLEN: No, no particular effect. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Not many of the men went to the war? 



JOHN ALLEN: Oh yes, quite a number did. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: So you came to <Flagstaff> then in…? 



JOHN ALLEN: In 1945. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Where did you live between <Palo Verde> and <Flagstaff>, other areas? 



JOHN ALLEN: Oh, I've been all over the state. 



LOLA ALLEN: But between <Palo Verde> and <Flagstaff>, <Phoenix>, <Tempe>, and we came up here from <Scottsdale>. We were there fifteen years before we came up here. 



JOHN ALLEN: I was at the high school in <Scottsdale>. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: That's when you started getting into teaching high school? 



JOHN ALLEN: Well, we had done high school work at <Palo Verde>. I was operating a one-man high school: seventh, eighth, no ninth, tenth, and eleventh grade, operating a one-man high school in <Palo Verde>. 



LOLA ALLEN: Then they had to go to Buckeye for… really to compete. 



JOHN ALLEN: To graduate they had to go to an organized high school. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: So, how did you get your job in <Flagstaff>? Did you just hear of an opening and apply? 



JOHN ALLEN: I was at the university, at the Teacher's College, and I heard there was a vacancy. I went up and interviewed the superintendent and he says that's it, and I said I'll take it. 



LOLA ALLEN: That was J.Q. Thomas, was the superintendent then. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was he like as a person? 



JOHN ALLEN: Well, he ran the school. The school board elected him to, or selected him to run the school, and they let him run it, and he did it and did real well. Very fine man. He was here for years and years before we came. Two years after we came, I guess he left, didn't he? 



LOLA ALLEN: I got my job up here before he left. It was the second year we were here. I started to go back to teaching, and he was the one that hired me over at South Beaver, and I was over there ten years. Asked for a transfer to Emerson because it was near home. Kept on for four years over there, then I quit. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Have you always lived in this home? 



LOLA ALLEN: We lived in Clark Homes when we came here. The property seemed high rent seemed high. 



JOHN ALLEN: There weren't anything to rent. 



LOLA ALLEN: There wasn't much, anyway. So we lived over there in Clark Homes for seven years. We bought this place in 1952, and it just fits us. We've been here ever since. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, had Clark Homes just been built about that time? 



JOHN ALLEN: It was built during World War II. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: So there was still probably a fairly large population from the Navajo Army Depot? 



JOHN ALLEN: Well, workmen there. They just needed ground. There weren't any rentals in town, and they needed emergency rentals, and so we got in under that rule. 



LOLA ALLEN: You'd be surprised at how many professional people were over there at that time. Doctors, teachers, university. It seemed to be the only place to go, temporarily at least. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Maybe we can talk about some of the teachers that you taught with those first few years. Well, we can talk to Mr. Allen first, get the people at South Beaver. Do you remember any particularly well that were there when you started? 



JOHN ALLEN: Yes. There are only two that are left there now though, that were there then. That's Mr. Killip and Mr. Clark, those are the only two that are left. And there was one math teacher and I was it. I did it all. But before I left there were half a dozen of them. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: How large were your classes? 



JOHN ALLEN: From a dozen to thirty. The higher math, maybe a dozen. About thirty in the algebra and geometry classes. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: You taught classes all day long, then? 



JOHN ALLEN: Yes. Six periods a day. I think they have five classes. Full schedule. Then there was extracurricular work and athletics and dramatics, and to take care of the plays, and the dance, and the games. No extra pay for that. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: But you had to coach the sports? 



JOHN ALLEN: No, they had a coach. Don Clark was the coach then. Mr. Killip was in mechanical arts department. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was Olive McNerny? 



JOHN ALLEN: Oh, yes. She was there. 



LOLA ALLEN: Roy Smith was there before you left. 



JOHN ALLEN: Before I left… 



LOLA ALLEN: And he's still there. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What does he teach? 



JOHN ALLEN: He supervises the athletic program, I think, with the state schools, for this school. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Who did you teach with at South Beaver? 



LOLA ALLEN: Mr. Weitzel was principal at that time. I don't think there's anyone left over there that was teaching there then. The last one retired last year, Charlotte Fern. She was there when I went there, and she's gone. Mrs. Barney, Mrs. Evans, Ruby Kehn, Mrs. Bergman. A lot of us were retiring. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was the school like? Was it pretty much the way it is now? 



LOLA ALLEN: No. It was mostly Mexican children. Before I left, there were some blacks. One year I had one white child, who was the son of a high school teacher, Mr. White’s (?) boy. I taught first grade mostly, over there. A little music. I liked it. Those children are… well it seems as though they were more respectful, disciplined at that time anyway. Their upbringing was different. I left just because I decided it was better to be nearer home when I could be. But the ten years over there was very good, and we had no teacher's aides when we taught, and besides teaching school all day, we had lunch duty; we had a full time job. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was the parents' opinions towards public education at that time? 



JOHN ALLEN: Well, I guess they respected the schools. They cooperated real well. We had a Negro school in town, a black school, the Dunbar School, but it was at the request of the colored people. They wanted a school of their own, and it was established for them at their request. And they weren't segregated because someone else wanted them there, although the state law required the segregation of Negroes in the grades. We ignored it for the junior high. And the high school, they were not segregated so we always had blacks. 



LOLA ALLEN: You probably heard of Wilson Riles who is now Superintendent of Public Instruction in <California>. He was principal of this little Dunbar School when we came here. Very fine man. He and his wife, I believe, had the school. His wife taught, too. I think there was just the two of them. I'm not saying that officially but that's… was a fairly small school. He taught as well as being principal. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: And then when they were out of the grade school then they went to the junior high and the high school, without any problems? 



JOHN ALLEN: Yes. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was there a bus system for the kids who lived in the outlying areas then? 



JOHN ALLEN: There wasn't a bus in the region. 



LOLA ALLEN: Didn't they come up from <Sedona> at that time same as they do now? I think there must have been 



JOHN ALLEN: We brought them to the high schools from <Sedona>. There was no bus (?). 



LOLA ALLEN: And for all of this vast area 



JOHN ALLEN: And there was one that came from Tudorville (?). Out east twenty miles. There was a bus from out there. There were two busses out there. There was one from the Ordnance. 



LOLA ALLEN: Yes, there had to be a few busses 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: The children who lived in east Flag, in order to come over, didn't they have to walk? 



LOLA ALLEN: Well, there wasn't much East Flag there. It developed after we came here. It was Sunnyside when we 



JOHN ALLEN: I guess they had a bus. 



LOLA ALLEN: There must have been 



JOHN ALLEN: There were a few busses. 



LOLA ALLEN: I don't know what the school population was at that time. I just found out this morning the population for 1940 was fifty-eight hundred people. In 1956, it was still only seventy-six hundred. But I couldn't get the figures for 1945. I thought it was somewhere around six thousand at that time. So you can see we've seen lots and lots of development of all kinds. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yes. Is there any way you can kind of guess when a lot of the development took place? Since you've been here? Because, boy, to gain that much population. 



LOLA ALLEN: Well mostly on through the sixties, I think the late fifties and the sixties when it really started. 



JOHN ALLEN: It started when our girls graduated up here from the Teachers' College. 



LOLA ALLEN: No, they graduated in the early fifties, and I suppose there were six hundred students. The only buildings over there were these beautiful old sandstone buildings. And we watched that grow up, too. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: That was in the early sixties? 



LOLA ALLEN: Fifties they graduated. And from then on it gradually, or not so gradually, developed. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Have you seen the tourism really pick up a lot or was it pretty heavy when you came? 



LOLA ALLEN: It was always a tourist center but for the size of the town, of course, it was nothing in comparison to what it is now. Just very few motels. This new road to <Grand Canyon> was developed or opened in the sixties, I guess. 



JOHN ALLEN: The college advancement made the town grow, change. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: That's a big change that you noticed. 



LOLA ALLEN: Then industry began to grow. Everything, one thing led to another. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was the downtown area like? 



JOHN ALLEN: I'll tell you. Narrow streets, high curbs. Actually you couldn't open the door of a car on some of the curbs. The streets have been filled in now until they come up to the sidewalk level. 



LOLA ALLEN: Really, right downtown they haven't been widened. There just hasn't been the space to widen them; they are still too narrow for a town of this size. 



JOHN ALLEN: But the curbs have been changed. They built the streets up to them. Actually, you can open the door and get out. And get out on the street side. 



LOLA ALLEN: It was only in places. 



JOHN ALLEN: Yes, North San Francisco was one of the worst. 



LOLA ALLEN: And right downtown on Leroux. I think it was around where Firestone is now someplace, there was a high curb that you couldn't open on the right hand side. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Have there been many buildings added since then? 



JOHN ALLEN: Yes, indeed. 



LOLA ALLEN: I think there was nothing over on Birch for business buildings at that time. 



JOHN ALLEN: There wasn't anything out there except houses, west of the Courthouse, there were just houses, residences all the way down past Safeway and past the Valley Bank, where the newer ones of them, those were just residences in there. 



LOLA ALLEN: Aspen, San Francisco, Leroux, Santa Fe, that was practically the boundary of the business area. 



JOHN ALLEN: The bank was where Sprouse Reitz is now. That was the only bank in town. There was one real estate office, Mrs. Quackenbush, the real estate office. There was not a building and loan in town. And only one real estate office. There were two doctors. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Which doctors were those? 



JOHN ALLEN: Dr. Fronske and Dr. Sechrist. 



LOLA ALLEN: Dr. Raymond, I think, was still alive. He was retired. Dr. Rice came shortly after. He was one of the professional men who lived over in Clark Homes. Well Dr. Creighton was, he may have been gone by that time, too. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: But, certainly just a handful of doctors when compared to all of them now. 



LOLA ALLEN: Dr. Mackey, Dr. Stilley, Dr. Lindemann were just about… they were dentists, too. Dr. Mackey was just about to retire then. Dr. Stilley and Dr. Lindemann still here. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was there a hospital then, or where was it located? 



LOLA ALLEN: Where the community hospital is now was Dr. Sechrist's small, private hospital. The Sechrist's donated that to the community a good many years back. But it was just that beautiful little center building that used to be there that was the hospital. And then Mercy Hospital, I believe, was still operating when we came here. That was in an old house over… well it's near the Holiday Inn now. It was a sawmill at that time. That was really the mill's hospital. I don't know how long that lasted after we came. 



JOHN ALLEN: Was that the private hospital up there on the hill? 



LOLA ALLEN: That opened, I believe, in, well, it was in the mid-thirties. 



JOHN ALLEN: Thirty-six. 



LOLA ALLEN: In 1936. We had occasion to stop by there when we were up here one summer. And it was very new then. Dr. Sechrist was head of it, and Mrs. Sechrist kept the landscaping so beautifully there for many, many years, even after they turned… 



JOHN ALLEN: Turned it over to the hospital association. She'd go out there and be dressed in her overalls, and doing the garden work with a helper. 



LOLA ALLEN: The whole front from the hospital grounds were beautifully kept. See, Dr. Gilbert Sechrist is his son. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Who were your neighbors at that time? 



JOHN ALLEN: Just those at Clark Homes who were renting like we were. We didn't have much in common with them. 



LOLA ALLEN: Well, Roy Smith moved in next door to us after we had been there. 



JOHN ALLEN: Dr. Downum was there from the University. 



LOLA ALLEN: Mr. Derifield(?)… I don't like to start naming names, because I know I'll leave out so many that we knew who lived there. When we moved over here, this old house, Mr. Pullen was there, he was one of the high school teacher. 



JOHN ALLEN: Dr. Butchard was there, in Clark Homes. 



LOLA ALLEN: Yes. 



JOHN ALLEN: Mr. Pullen was principal of the high school when I began there. And he was still teaching there when I retired in 1961. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: He's been around for quite a while. 



LOLA ALLEN: No, he left then pretty soon after that. 



JOHN ALLEN: About two or three more years after he stayed. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: You mentioned some of the people are still living back on up toward the observatory now that were here. 



LOLA ALLEN: Well, our street. 



JOHN ALLEN: Mr. Godwin. 



LOLA ALLEN: The Godwins are still up there. So many of those up this street are some of those that retired and felt that they had to go to a warmer place. 



JOHN ALLEN: They did. They went down to <Cottonwood> or <Sun City>. 



LOLA ALLEN: And as far as <Yuma>, some of them. There are some others up there I know… 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you know Mrs. Compton? 



JOHN ALLEN: Yes. And she would know more about this country than anyone else that I know of. 



LOLA ALLEN: Well, Mrs. Compton that lived down this street has gone now to <Cottonwood> that home down there. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh. 



LOLA ALLEN: Mrs. Flora Compton, that lives right up here on Aspen, is one who was born in this house right over here on the corner. 



JOHN ALLEN: Right across there. 



LOLA ALLEN: The old white house… 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: The little white one. It's on Bonita and Santa Fe. Right on the corner of Bonita and Santa Fe. 



LOLA ALLEN: She was born there. When she was married in 1921 she moved up here in the seven hundred block on west Santa Fe, and she lived there all her life. 



JOHN ALLEN: She was very active and alert. If you can get a tape from her it will be authentic. 



LOLA ALLEN: Someone may already have done so. I noticed her name was one of those that was in the Pow Wow section of the paper. But she knows all about this town. 



JOHN ALLEN: Maybe just this Monday, wasn't it? 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did she teach school? Was she teaching school? 



LOLA ALLEN: She did teach but not after me. I don't think she taught after she was married, as far as I know. But she did teach here, and they named some other places in the paper where she had taught. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Who was running the observatory? 



JOHN ALLEN: Mr. Giclas was there. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh. 



LOLA ALLEN: Oh, the people who own the Marsh (?) property. Dr. Slipher was still up there. 



JOHN ALLEN: Oh yeah, Slipher was there. 



LOLA ALLEN: And Mr. Tombaugh, who really was… they don't give him much credit for having discovered Pluto, but he was really the one who located Pluto. He was up there at that time. He was a young man then. Mr. Giclas… 



JOHN ALLEN: His house was right over here on Aspen, in the next block. 



LOLA ALLEN: Used to be, yes. 



JOHN ALLEN: He’s in <New Mexico> now. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was Mr. Hochderffer still around? 



LOLA ALLEN: Yes, we used to hear the name. We didn't know him. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: You did never know him? 



JOHN ALLEN: I think he lived down on Cherry. 



LOLA ALLEN: I didn't even know where he lived. Oh, who is it that has the sporting goods store? Tissaw’s. 



JOHN ALLEN: Tissaw's. 



LOLA ALLEN: Tissaw senior still lives over here on Aspen. He's lived there many years. I can't think of any more. I know there are more. Up there are the Conrad's, that have been way up on the street for a long long time. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you know Mr. Fuss? 



JOHN ALLEN: Oh, yes. 



LOLA ALLEN: Yes, he lives up here on Aspen, yet. They're still there. No, not Aspen. They live right on Santa Fe. 



JOHN ALLEN: Jack Fuss, he was a sign painter. 



END SIDE I, TAPE I, BEGINNING SIDE II, TAPE I 



JOHN ALLEN: He knows plenty about the early days when they tried to drive a herd of deer across the <Grand Canyon>. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: He was also involved in the Pow Wow. What was the Pow Wow like in 1945? 



JOHN ALLEN: Well, they lived in shelters, the people that came to Pow Wow, and they came in wagons. And they had stations along the way from the reservation stations where they could stop and get food. And they came in their wagons, and they lived in shelters and tents. And they'd hang wires around from trees, and the jerky'd be hanging on the wires. And, nearly always they'd be caught in the rain. And there would be some births occur, and they’d have to rush them to the hospital. Oh, it was quite a wild time. 



LOLA ALLEN: It happened the first year of the POW Wow. We were living in City Park. At that time they had cabins there for summer people. And I can't remember that first POW Wow except it began in 1929, and we were living up there. We were up here for summer school and that was out in the forest. But I noticed in the paper yesterday that their first year was 1929, and we were right there. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was it always as crowded as it is now? 



JOHN ALLEN: Oh, yes. It was crowded. And they didn't have all those booths to sell things. They just kinda had lots of little stands here and there. People didn't come in and build up buildings. They would sell things from the back of their wagons. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did they still have the ceremonial dances? 



JOHN ALLEN: Oh, yes. They had those, and they were pretty good. Governor Pyle used to be the chief announcer. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did they have any other type of Fourth of July celebration? 



LOLA ALLEN: Not that I know of. 



JOHN ALLEN: I don't think so. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: It was just all centered on the Pow Wow? No firecrackers? 



JOHN ALLEN: Well, firecrackers were forbidden in the forest, but they evaded that a little. <Williams> always had the display of fireworks on the Fourth of July; not <Flagstaff>, we had the Pow Wow. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Can you remember much about social life of the community? What people got together to do? 



LOLA ALLEN: I don't know when this square dance club was organized, it's been going for a long time. There was more connected with the churches, perhaps. There's always been the cards clubs, the lodges. I don't really know. We weren't too socially inclined. I don't know what they did. 



JOHN ALLEN: They had a theater, a movie. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Which one was that? The Orpheum? Was it in its present condition? 



JOHN ALLEN: Yes, right where it is now. And, I suppose the price of a show was thirty-five or fifty cents? 



LOLA ALLEN: I don't know. We don't go anymore. One of those things that we feel we can get along with out at the present price. We never cared much about them, anyway. And there used to be some good ones; there's so few good ones now. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any of the city officials or representatives to the state legislature, particularly? 



JOHN ALLEN: Yes, we knew them all, I guess. Probably personally we knew them all. Were well acquainted with them a small place. 



LOLA ALLEN: But, who were they then? 



JOHN ALLEN: Oh, Frank Christensen was in the state legislature. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was Mr.… now maybe I'm completely off base, Mr. Runke, do you remember him? J and 



LOLA ALLEN: Oh, yes. 



JOHN ALLEN: He was at one time post master here. He was in charge of Clark Homes when we were there. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: He wasn't involved in the government too much then? 



JOHN ALLEN: No, he had been before. He had been on the reservation. I think he worked for the government. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Mr. Knoles, was he? 



JOHN ALLEN: Oh yes. Mr. Knoles. He served on the school board before he went to the legislature. And then he was in there for quite a number of years. I had his sons in school. 



LOLA ALLEN: I don't know who the school board was when we came here. 



JOHN ALLEN: Mr. Dolan and Dr. Sechrist ______. That's the three I believe. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh there was just the three. What big snows can you remember that have _________? 



JOHN ALLEN: We were here two years of the big snows. 



LOLA ALLEN: 1949, we were still in Clark Homes. We were both having to get out fairly early every morning. The streets then… they didn't have too much snow equipment. They plowed the snow all to the center. 



JOHN ALLEN: And off of the sidewalks. 



LOLA ALLEN: And the sidewalks. It got so high in the middle; you couldn't see the car on the other side. You'd get to an intersection, and you'd stop and see if anybody else was ready to cross. Very few accidents. Everybody was careful. It was started, I think Christmas Eve of '48. And for two months it snowed more or less every day. We didn't have the chains off the car for two months. I can't remember the number of inches of snow that year. Wasn't as great as the two hundred and ten inches here two or three years ago, but it just kept coming. It kept coming; didn't have a chance to melt in between. It was just kind of an adventure. Nobody seemed to mind it too much. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were things closed down during that period? 



JOHN ALLEN: No. 



LOLA ALLEN: Not much. They just... 



JOHN ALLEN: Everything went on. 



LOLA ALLEN: I suppose there may have been a few snow holidays, but there have been since, too. But they just some way or other kept up with it. I can't remember the, that's the one I remember particularly. 



JOHN ALLEN: There was another one after we got here. 



LOLA ALLEN: Yes. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: In sixty something? 



JOHN ALLEN: Yes. 



LOLA ALLEN: Yes. 



JOHN ALLEN: In the sixties. No, that was before I retired. 



LOLA ALLEN: In 1957 was a big snow. 



JOHN ALLEN: '57. 



LOLA ALLEN: There was another one in the sixties. But some way or other, that first one was that we remembered particularly. Because we had to get out, had to get going. We made it. Lots of snow to shovel. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any dry periods, exceptionally dry periods or water shortages? 



JOHN ALLEN: We were here when <Mormon Lake> went dry. In fact I went out and gathered up some catfish about two feet long. Then got three or four of them out of some those little pools that were being left. And brought them to a tub, kept them alive and we’d eat one. And then when we get tired of… we eat another one. 



LOLA ALLEN: I don't… what was it '57? One year we had to stop watering lawns in July. We had been able to water up until that time. 



JOHN ALLEN: Couldn't even wash cars. 



LOLA ALLEN: Couldn't even wash cars. But the lawns survived. They had been watered long enough, and when the rains… the rains were late, that year. When they finally came, why everything was refreshed. That was the only time. 



JOHN ALLEN: We even saved bath water to put on the shrubs. 



LOLA ALLEN: Took it out of the bathtub and carried it out to keep that alive. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: But <Mormon Lake> went completely dry. 



JOHN ALLEN: Oh yes, completely dry. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What shape was Lake Mary in? 



JOHN ALLEN: There was no upper Lake Mary at that time. The dam hadn't been built there. And so the lower lake, well it had water. The upper dam hadn't been built. 



LOLA ALLEN: Our water supply came from these reservoirs out north here at that time. “Ninety-nine and forty-four hundreds per cent pure,” they used to say. Just like Ivory Soap. It was good water, entirely snow water. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember when they switched over to using Lake Mary? 



LOLA ALLEN: No, I don't. We didn't have any wells then. I don't know when we finally outgrew the reservoirs. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: That's interesting. I didn't know that they were using them, you know, even in the 1940s. Do you remember any flooding? 



LOLA ALLEN: Not severe enough. There've been times when the Rio de Flag was pretty full. Out here in this first subdivision that was built, what do we call it? 



JOHN ALLEN: Mountain View. 



LOLA ALLEN: Mountain View that was built after we came here. That used to be a flooded area. 



JOHN ALLEN: There was a dairy farm there. Wasn't anything there except just pastureland where Mountain View is, and all the way north almost to the Museum? The Museum was there, though. 



LOLA ALLEN: But that area used to flood. When they started developing it, there was quite a little question as to whether it really would work or not. But they did a lot of filling, a lot of draining. That was the old Clark Ranch, part of the old Clark Ranch up there. 



JOHN ALLEN: Over where the Safeway is now, that was all filled in with little cottages that were rented to mill workers. Little shacks, sheds. Maybe be an outside spigot for them to get water to carry in their houses. No sanitary facilities there. And some of that region where that… just beyond the Safeway, that used to get flooded; there was a low place. Remember those pools that used to be over there? 



LOLA ALLEN: I can't remember any flooding since we've been here that did any, really any serious damage. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: That's interesting, knowing where it used to fill in with water. 



JOHN ALLEN: Before they built those stone cottages in Cottage City over at the University, they had little wooden houses. And summer students would come up from the valley, come up there. And they could rent one of those for a dollar and a half a week. There was a stove in it, and pots. 



LOLA ALLEN: We lived there. 



JOHN ALLEN: You go to summer school for maybe thirty dollars a month and live in these little cottages. (all laugh). Oh my! And then they built the stone cottages. And, I think, they rented for two dollars and a half a week, something like that. Oh, they were getting high totting (?) then. (all laugh)
