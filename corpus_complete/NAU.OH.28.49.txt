KRISTINE PRENNACE: This is an interview with Paul Babbitt, Sr. who was born in <Flagstaff> in 1898, and who has worked as an attorney for the Babbitt Brothers Trading Co. since about 1944. The interview is being conducted on June 15th, 1976 in Mr. Babbitt's home at 411 N. Leroux in <Flagstaff> by Kristine Prennace, representing the Flagstaff City-Coconino County Public Library.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Mr. Babbitt, when and where were you born?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: I was born in <Flagstaff> in 1898, May 21st.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: And who were your parents?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: My parents were Mr. and Mrs. Charles J. Babbitt.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: And where did they come from originally?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Ah, both of them came from <Cincinnati Ohio>. My father and my mother.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: And do you remember about when they came here?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Oh, I believe it was about 1886, I think.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was your father involved in mainly? Which part of the Babbitt business?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Well he was in the livestock, the ranches mostly.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: And who are your brothers and sisters?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: I just have one brother living, John G. Babbitt.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: And what other brothers and sisters did you have before?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Well, James Babbitt, he died. And my sister, Helen Babbitt. And there were some younger children, but I don't…



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Those are the main ones. Where did you receive most of your schooling as a child?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Here in <Flagstaff>.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Which school?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: The Nativity, the Catholic school.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was that like at that time?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: It was a very small little building. And they didn't have a great many students then. Sisters of Loretto were the teachers.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any classmates particularly well that you went to school?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Oh yes. Just in general I haven't seen any for a long time. There were the Hennesseys, there was John and Jim and Elizabeth Hennessey. And then there were the Campbells, Jane and Frankie and Clara. C l a r a, Clara Campbell. And, oh, there was a John Donahue, too.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was he any relation to Sandy Donahue?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Yes. I think his father was a brother of Sandy Donahue's. And at one time, John Donahue ran the Commercial Hotel. And this was his son who I know, and classmate.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Anyone else you can remember?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Well, there was Gaston Aubineau and Jules, and I think the other brother was older. But the Aubineaus were neighbors. They lived next door to us. Let’s see that would have been on Beaver, and oh, I'm not sure. It was on Beaver. That's between Cherry and Birch, that's where it was. And now, let's see. You want more of them? The McGonigle girls. Have you heard of any of these before, and all that I've mentioned?



KRISTINE PRENNACE: A few of them I have, not all of them.



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Let me see. There was Clair McGonigle that was one of them, and I can't, Veronica. Clair and Veronica McGonigle.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember what the McGonigle family did?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Yes. The father was an officer in the Flagstaff Lumber Company. He was in the lumber business all his life. I think at one time he worked for the Riordans, see, the Arizona Lumber and Timber Company. And then when the new mill was formed, he went over to the new mill, I don't know as superintendent or in some capacity.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: They were the McGonigle girls?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Yes. Oh my.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: I'm taking you back a few years trying to remember.



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: I haven't… if I had a picture I'd probably be able to recognize quite a few. Let me see if I could think. There were a number of Spanish speaking students, but I just can't think of their names right now. There were quite a few.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: But they came to school here at Nativity?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Yes, yes.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: That was quite a ways for them to come. Did most of them live over…?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Oh yes, most of them lived here. And a great many of them worked at the lumber mill. Albert Santiamos (?), don't ask me how to spell that. I think he is still living, but I haven't seen for a long, long time. And that's really all I recollect just off hand.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Sure. That’s good. You came up with a lot of them. Do you remember any special activities that you had at school? Anything that will stick in your mind? Plays or anything?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: No. I can't remember anything in particular. They would put on plays once in awhile, I think.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did they have any sports for the kids to play basketball or football?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: No regular teams, none. No. At recess you'd play out in the yard, maybe baseball or something, but there wasn't any competition that I can remember. I don't think so.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Where did you go on, you did go on in your schooling after Nativity, didn't you?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Yes. We moved to <Los Angeles>. I think it was about in 1913, probably. My mother and father moved to <Los Angeles>, and we lived there for a long, long time. So while I was born here in <Flagstaff>, my residence wasn't absolute continuous by any means.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: So you did a lot of your other schooling was over in <California>?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Yes, let's see. I went to high school at Loyola, at Loyola High School in <Los Angeles>. And also to college there for three years. And then I went one year to Georgetown, where I… Washington, that's where I graduated.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was your degree in?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: It was a AB, just a AB. Then later on I went to law school. And I have a LLB, a law degree.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Where did you get your law degree?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: At Loyola, too.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, you went back to Loyola?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Yeah.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: I see, okay. Do you remember any particular daily chores you had as a child? Daily types of activities to help the family?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Oh, (laughs), of course in those days almost everyone had horses. We had a milk cow. And we were kept very busy. My father had a big garden. And we used to… I remember all of the corn. Oh, we'd milk a cow. And just chores around the house, you know. But ah, oh and of course, I used to work in the store maybe on Saturday, Saturdays, and, oh, once in awhile at other times. But not permanently, you know. We'd go work in the vegetable department or as cashier, just help down at the <Flagstaff> store.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you spend much time out at the ranch?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: No.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: You didn't?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: No. We all had horses. We had out on the… three or four horses. And of course that was the big thing in those days when there weren't any automobiles. That is probably the biggest change that I can think of is the difference in transportation, you know. And for recreation instead of going for automobile rides, oh, we would go on horseback. Oh, camp out, and really, it was quite a good form of amusement for us, too.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: When did you return to <Flagstaff>?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Well, in 1944 after the death of my brother, James.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Had he stayed over here?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Since 1944, yeah. Before that I lived in <Los Angeles>. I practiced law there first, for, oh, ten or fifteen years.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: When you came back, did you practice law here in town?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Well, I worked for the company. I did their legal work. I didn't do any general practice.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: When did you get married then?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Oh (laughs), goodness. My wife had just went out for a little bit. That is something…



KRISTINE PRENNACE: You don't remember anniversaries?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: I don't know. And if you ask me the birthday of my children, I’ll say, "I just can't tell you."

(Both laugh.)



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Oh, I should know when we were married, but I'd probably give you the wrong date, so I'd better pass.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, probably in the late twenties, early thirties?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Well in the thirties. I was middle or… let's see how old was I when I married. Thirty-five so, we…



KRISTINE PRENNACE: You can date it from then.



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: You could date it from that. Let me… thirty-five, so it would have been thirty-three about, wouldn't it?



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Thirty-seven?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Let's see, I was born in 1898. That's two years 'til 1900 and thirty-five, yes, it would be thirty-seven. You are right.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. And who is your wife?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Frances. Frances Perry, her maiden name was "Perry".



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was she from <Los Angeles>, then?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: She was from the state of <Washington>, really. And I met her while she was going to college in <Los Angeles>.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: And who are your children?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: You want me to enumerate them, there’s six.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, all right.



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: All right: Kenneth, Bruce, Paul Jr., Charles J., James E., and Christine, the only daughter. She is around; she may show up before long. I don't know, she just happens to be out now.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: How many, who is left in <Flagstaff>, then, of your children?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Who was born?



KRISTINE PRENNACE: No, who is living in <Flagstaff> now?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Paul, Jr. There are Kenneth, Paul, Jr., and Christine.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What type… well we've talked a little bit about your jobs. You are primarily a lawyer, most of your working… _____. Okay, we'll go on. Do you remember what the downtown area of <Flagstaff> was like as a child?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Oh, yes. It's a little bit hard to describe. Of course there weren't many buildings. And they were mostly these frame buildings. And, of course, there were wooden sidewalks all over. And no paved roads or anything like that. But I would say it was pretty much a typical small town. I don't know of any distinguishing characteristics, really.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was the inside of the Babbitt store like?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Well it was… it's been remodeled, I suppose a dozen times. And ah, it was always a department store. And there were several buildings, not adjoining. But there was a… called it the meat packinghouse which was in back of the present store. It's been torn down. There they made sausage and lard and like that. Then, of course, there was also a hay barn where they kept hay, I guess, for their horses, because they made deliveries in those days. Even the groceries, you know, you could phone in and get a delivery man would take groceries all over town regardless of how much or how many items. And, I think that was about all that I can think of. Of course, there was what they called "The Empress Theater" was at one time. It is, I guess, one of the first moving picture houses in <Flagstaff> adjoining the department store building.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: It was right down town?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Yes.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What type of merchandise did they handle?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: It was a department store. It was, oh, groceries, meat and ladies wear and mens wear. Hardware, there was a big hardware department. And I think, you know, sold just about everything a department store would handle in those days.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any of the other stores in town?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Yes. There was Keller's, which was across the street almost. It was confectionery. And they carried papers, and, ah… Katherine Keller Rucker. You didn't happen to interview her, did you?



KRISTINE PRENNACE: No, I didn't know she was…



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: I believe she would be pretty good. I think they used … R U C K E R. But it was her father… my, were real old time residents. And I think they called it "Keller's Bakery", maybe. And, oh yes, there were, and then there was a man who owned a store on Front Street. It's now Santa Fe Avenue. Balzer Hock, another real old times. Have you ever heard of him?



KRISTINE PRENNACE: No, I haven't. Uh uh. What was he like?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Oh, he was a German, Balzer Hock. And, ah, he had a son, I think, that probably went to school with Ramintnes’ (?) son. This is a newsstand that he operated on Front Street. And, oh there were, 'course there were a couple of blacksmith shops. You can see them in these old pictures, you know, pretty well. But I can't think of anything that would be of particular interest. There were a lot of stores, and, ah…



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember Mr. Switzer?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Oh yes. Yes, in fact he once managed the hardware department for Babbitts'. Yes, yes, we knew him quite well as he is very good, good friend of ours.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: I think we've describe a lot of the people that were living then. We haven't really describe your father very well, though. Can you describe him to me? Because I was just curious…



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Oh, that I don't know if… He was one of the five brothers, and he was particularly interested, as I said, in the ranches and the livestock business. And later, in fact at one time, he… or, I think the first two or three years he actually rode the range. He was really a cowboy or the equivalent of it. And that didn't last long until he had his office in the store. Then, oh, he was quite, quite busy. He'd go to <Kansas>, all over. And also, he managed the Indian trading posts out on the Indian reservation, you know. And oh, he was really an expert on Indian blankets and baskets.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember if that was located on the reservation, was it by <Tuba  City> or…?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Well, it was a number of trading posts. It wasn't just one. It was, oh, at that time, there was <Red Lake> and <Tuba>. And those were the two principal ones, I think. Of course, while he was living, there were a great many more. There was Cow Springs, and Kaibito, and <Oraibi>, and <Willow Springs>. But at the time, see, I'm just going back when it was getting started really. But, oh, my father was really an exceptional man. Everybody liked him. He was very, very well liked. And he was a very good businessman. Particularly he, oh, he was good with gardening. He was kind of like a… he's a New Englander, you know, in fact they were… his father was from <Massachusetts>. But, yes, he was very capable. And those were his two special specialties, was the livestock business and Indian trading posts.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What did he do in L.A.[<Los Angeles>] when he moved over there?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Well, he didn't stay over. He spent a great deal of time over here. And then he'd go back. We were all going to school. And my mother and sister kind of took care of us. And, of course, my father would come over on visits and vacations.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: And he was still very involved with the business.



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Yes, yes continually. He never really gave up his business.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was the move to <California> primarily so you could go to school at the schools over in there?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Yes that was it. And my mother's health. She was in poor health, and this high altitude… she couldn't live here. She was very nervous. She just couldn't stand this altitude, really.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember much about the social life of the <Flagstaff> community?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: No, I really don't. I… let me see. 'Course there were dances and things like that. But we were too young then, I guess. I think that the churches used to have affairs, but I don't know. See, we left here when I was fairly young. But there was a great deal of, oh, dancing parties and things like that was about. And picnics and get togethers like that, you know. Go out some place and the whole family and friends and have picnics.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Where did you have those? Any particular place?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Well, quite a few of them were out there near Elden mountain, not very far from where East <Flagstaff> is. Elden Springs, we used to go where the springs… and drive out on Sunday afternoon in the horse and buggy, you know. My father liked that. And, oh we'd go any number of places that weren't too far away.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: At Elden Springs, was the Elden cabin still standing?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Oh, yes. Yes, I remember it well. It wasn't too long ago…



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Parts of it, I think, are still there. But the structure…

 

END SIDE 1, TAPE 1, BEGINNING TAPE 1, SIDE 2



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you ever go to <Walnut Canyon>?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Yes, yes we used to go there, too, and Sunset Crater, and go up on the mountain. But those were for picnics, you know, weren't any really long trips.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: When you'd go up on the Peaks, did you go up Weatherford Road, do you remember?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Well this was before Weatherford Road was built is what I'm thinking about. Of course the Michelbachs had a ranch up on Hart Prairie. And, one of our cattle companies that had a summer range, a forest permit up there on the mountain, and we'd go up there well, every once in awhile.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you know any of the Michelbachs?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Oh yes, all of them are dead.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did some of them go to school with you, too?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Well, I don't know, Eva might have. That's Eva Cavaness, now. Do you know Eva?



KRISTINE PRENNACE: I… yeah, I believe we interviewed her.



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Well you want to get after her. Yes, Pete Michelbach, he was from <Germany>. And he had a big farm, more potatoes. It's still up there. The Michelbachs still own it. And he used to have a wagon, I guess you've heard that. Drive into town. It was quite a familiar sight around here, in his wagon driving.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: We talked a little bit about the Nativity Church. Do you remember any clergymen particularly well?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Well, of course, Father Fabre. Of course, you know, or have heard of him, probably.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: In connection with the Museum. I believe he had an Indian collection.



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Well…



KRISTINE PRENNACE: That's the only way I've heard of him so you can describe him.



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Have you worked out at the Museum, too, or…?



KRISTINE PRENNACE: No, no.



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Well, he was a French man. He was from <France>. And he even spoke a little brokenly. But he was very well thought of. And he was pastor there for a long time. In fact, I think he was the first pastor that I remember. There was a Father Dilly. I met him, too, at a later date when he wasn't pastor anymore. But I think Father Dilly… there is an article written on, I think… the Catholic Church. Have you seen that? Gosh, I should get that for you. It gives quite a bit of history, in fact all the history. I think the Riordans prepared that, Mike Riordan. But anyhow, he was the pastor who I first remember. And then, of course, Father Albouy came after him.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any of the ceremonies connected with the church like, I don't know, if the Catholic Church has christenings? Do you remember any of those social kinds of things?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Oh, not particularly.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Any weddings that you can recall?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Oh yes, of course, in the early days, before we moved to <Los Angeles>, I was fairly young, you know. And it wasn't as if I'd been grown up then. I do remember Admission Day. (laughs)



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh.



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: When was that, in 1912 wasn't it? I think we got a holiday then, or something.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: (laughs) Did they have ceremonies or celebrations?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Well I don't think they heard about it until about noon or sometime. I think they probably did. But we were going to school, and it would have been a school day, except I think we got a half a day off or something. And I do remember a little earthquake we had here when I was going to Nativity School. And that's what made me think about it. It was quite a strong shock. In fact it knocked some of the plaster off our old house. That would have been, I can't tell you. I must have been seven or eight years old then. It was the only real earthquake that I've ever heard of occurring here in <Flagstaff>. Have you heard of any?



KRISTINE PRENNACE: I haven't.



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: No, no.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: It was fairly strong, though?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Yes it was. We were all in school, and everybody jumped up out of their seats. It was quite strong.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did it last very long?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: No.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Just a few minutes. I'm trying to think of things you might recall as a child. Do you remember any flooding in the area?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Oh my, yes. Yes. The River de Flag used to kind of go on a rampage once in awhile. I've seen pictures of the rafts (?). I think it used to get right up into the Weatherford Hotel there. But it flooded, and of course out here… what do they call this subdivision north of town?



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Cheshire area.



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: No, this side.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: There is a name for it, and I don't remember.



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Yes, yes. I don't remember. But it would be badly flooded.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: It's like across from the Sechrist School, out in that area?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Yes, yes. They had very bad floods. Of course the River de Flag ran through there. They just haven't had any of those big floods for a long… as long for as I can remember.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Not that bad?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: It used to really flood the downtown area.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any big snows?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Well, yes, of course, fairly recently, those two, you know, fairly recent ones. But, when I was a child, I don't remember any except, I wasn't here when the Orpheum Theater… You know they had a very heavy snow, and it caved the roof in. We were away at school at that time.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: That was 1915?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: I think so, yes. And, of course, in modern times, have you been here during either of these recent big storms?



KRISTINE PRENNACE: One of them. Do you think the winters… well as a child it's hard for you to recall, but do you think the winters are any worse now, or than they were then? Or do you think they were the same?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: I think that winters seemed longer then.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Longer? (laughs)



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Yes, and, ah, I think, I don't think there's been too much change, really. Kind of up and down. I know when my father first came here, and his brothers, from <Cincinnati>, they came sometime in the winter. And it was what they called a "open winter"; you know, hardly… very mild winter and not much snow. And I think that may have had something to do with their wanting to stay here. If they would have landed here in a big blizzard, they might have taken the next train out.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: They were kind of surprised the next year. Well, do you remember any fires?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Well, of course, these mills, as you know, are very susceptible to fires, or were. I think all of them have burnt down once or twice; <Williams> and <Winslow>. It's a very high casualty, it seems, to be… that the mills… you know that as well as I do, I guess. But…



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did any of them burn while you were a youngster?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Well, one of our lumber departments burnt, not when I was a youngster, but it was a big fire. I can't say that I remember any great big fires. 'Course they didn't have fire engines. They had these… what "hose carts" they called them. You've seen pictures. They called it the fire department. But, ah, no I just don't…



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were they horse drawn?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: No, no. They were men; they'd pull the cart. And they'd have teams competing on the Fourth of July. You know racing, seeing which was best.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember the Fourth of July celebrations?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Oh yes, I do. They made so much of it in the old days, far more than they do now. Everyone, almost every house would be decorated with bunting, you know, and American flags. They'd have parades and a band and one thing and another. They seemed to pay more attention to it… now or really. Oh, they had races and bronco busting.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was the Pow Wow going then?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: No, it was very much later, yeah.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: But, did Indians come into town at that time at all?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Well that's one big difference. You didn't see so many Indians. They lived way out on the reservation. And it would take them maybe two or three days to get in. And I don't think there were really many Indians here at the Fourth of July. No, they didn't predominate, certainly, at all.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: There weren't very many in town just on a regular basis either, then?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: No, no. When you had to come in the wagon, it’s different. We used to ride out horse back to the "snake dance" once in awhile. And, of course, that would take two or three days. But that was a hard trip. I remember once we were riding all the way from <Leupp> into town. That was about forty miles, you know, in a day. Oh, and when you'd go out to the Indian reservation in the summer time during the rainy season, you were almost sure to get bogged down.

 

They have these washes, you know. Have you been on the reservation? And you couldn't get across from there (?). You'd have to have a team to bring you across. No. That is one thing I think that there weren't a great many Indians in town, not only on the Fourth of July. Of course, the traders would come in, but the Indians, I guess… Most of them didn't have the means to come in. It's a long hard trip.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any black families in town?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Oh, there were very, very few, I think. There was one, Fuller, a man by the name of "Fuller". He was about the only black man that I can remember until the Cadys took over the lumber mill. And, of course they were from <Louisiana>, I think. And they, of course, had nearly all black employees. And when they opened the mill here, they all came in. That's where the black population here is kind of a off shoot from ______.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember where the Fullers lived?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Where the Fullers lived?



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh.



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: I think on the south side. But where I just don't remember. There undoubtedly were others, but, but not many. Uh uh, I don't…



KRISTINE PRENNACE: There were quite a few Mexican Americans.



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Yes, yes, yes. Of course, the lumber mill, the AL and T was really employed lots of people, and a great many of the people who worked in the mill were Mexicans. And I guess they had some on the railroad, too. But…



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were there many Oriental families?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Quite a few, judging by the restaurants.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, there were.



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: That's all I remember. I don't know, I think there probably were three or four Chinese restaurants. Chinese were well thought of in those days, I think. I do remember they'd always bring around, oh, presents. I guess it was the Chinese New Year, these leeche nuts, and ginger and one thing and another. That was kind of customary, in the early days, I think.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Who did they… just to people that they knew?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Yes, I think so. Oh yes. I think who they did business with. Probably I was exposed to it being at the store there, you know. And, of course, it wasn't me who… it was my parents probably or associates. But it was quite common.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: But you don't remember playing with any of their children?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: I don't remember ever seeing any of their children as a matter of fact.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Can't remember. Do you remember any epidemics or serious illnesses in the town?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Oh yes. Scarlet fever used to be the thing. My brothers, I think, had it. It affected one of my brother's hearing, I think. But, but scarlet fever, as I remember, seemed to be quite common for some reason. I don't, I don't remember any smallpox, but there probably was. But… and earaches. I just don't know. Of course, there were a lot of those common ailments, I suppose.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: That's interesting, that the scarlet fever… Do you remember any doctors particularly?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Oh yes, of course. Dr. Raymond took care of our family. Dr. Raymond, Dr. Schermann, of course, Dr. Fronske. I don't know if all of them were here in the real early days or not. Dr. Raymond… and I suppose… there was Dr. Brannen. I think he met my father and his brothers when they first came, P.J. Brannen. You probably have read about him in the local history of <Flagstaff>. The Brannen addition and the Brannen Building. I never knew him. That was… I guess I was too young then, probably. But he was a doctor here. And there were probably others. I didn't know them, or if they were named, I would probably recognize them.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, when you came back, that was in 1944, around there?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Yeah.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, okay. What would you think caused the greatest change in <Flagstaff>?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Well, I think the motels.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: The tourism? The ____.



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Yes, yes, I really think so. 'Course we used to, when we were going to school, we'd come back here for the summer, so there wasn't a sudden change.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh.



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: But that really was the… I think all these tourists, and tourism, paved good roads, and motels. Which was really… we used to drive from here to <Los Angeles>. And it'd take us about, oh, I think it would take us about three days lots of times. And we would (?) quite often just take along a bedroll and some utensils to cook in, you know, or to prepare meals. And I just don't… there weren't many places to stay, between here and <Los Angeles>.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember the Navajo Army Depot? Was it here when you came back?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: No, I wasn't… oh yes, it was here. Yes, it was operating. There were lots of people who worked out there. It brought lots… it gave lots of employment. And it brought in lots of Indians, too. As you know, they called it the Navajo Ordnance. As you probably know, they built a lot of homes out there for them. I think they've all gone now (?). They worked the store (?) _____. _____ I don’t know what else. They did most of the hard work, I think.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did that, brought a lot of Indians into town, then?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Yes it did, yes.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now these are things, I believe, kind of happened since you've been back. The summer festival. Do you remember that getting started?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Oh yes. That hasn't been going… what, three or four or five years. I don't know. Of course, Izler Solomon, I think he was the first conductor that came. Oh no… that's… yes, that was the festival _____. No, I'm not musically talented. (laughs)



KRISTINE PRENNACE: So you weren't really involved?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: No, no, I just… Oh, I go. My wife, Frances, is quite interested. She is a good musician herself, or was. She doesn't play any, anymore. Oh, she did play in the Santa Barbara Symphony at one time, I think. And we do go down to <Phoenix> to the Phoenix Symphony in the wintertime. It's a nice trip down. But that's the symphony, and you're asking about the Festival.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Either, yeah, either one.



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Yes, they're kind of associated. At least I kind of associate them together.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: So your wife might have been more involved?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Oh very definitely, yes. She…



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What about the development of East <Flagstaff>? That was fairly recent, also.



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Amazing! That… I mean that really is an amazing development. My father used to grow corn out there, you know. And had a cornfield there. And at one time, we, Babbitts, owned, oh, a section of land there, and that was probably one reason why we used to have the picnics out there, too. And then later on, they had a fox farm out there. It raised silver foxes in there (?). And oh, that operated for a number of years.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Who owned that, the fox farm?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Babbitts'.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Babbitts' did?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: A man by the name of Roy Fanning operated it. He might be… well I don't know. I guess you're finding plenty of prospects or victims.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: No, we're always looking for new names. Victims (both laugh). Yes, so that was fairly recently developed?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Oh yes. Yes, I don't know. It just developed very, very fast. I think, I think Steves Brothers had a whole lot to do with it. You know they just built houses and subdivided out there. And there was a need for housing, and it just really developed very, very fast. And there's more business out there now, I believe than there is here in <Flagstaff> ______. Fourth Street going down there, it's just crowded all the time, you know. All the stores. And there is lots of development going on. Have you been up there around Paradise Valley or those new streets? I guess it's an extension of Linda Vista, you know. That street; are you familiar with that?



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh.



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Well, there's just a lots of, quite a few new houses going in there in the trees. I think it's very attractive. Of course I do think they have water problems. But someday we'll have to _____ then.



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any water shortages? Water shortages, drought? Can you remember?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Oh, I think so. Of course it was I suppose, about the same time they had in <Flagstaff>, you know, where you couldn't water your lawn or wash your car. I don't know. I don't remember. That must have been in the late forties or fifties. Not real long, long time ago. As you know, I think, in the very early days… certainly I don't remember that. They used to sell water by the barrel from the springs. And they had a little reservoir out there near the Flagstaff Country Club, just very small. And it's been abandoned since. But…



KRISTINE PRENNACE: That's the "old Country Club"?



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Yes, the <Flagstaff>, not Continental. And of course, Aubineau, I think, they built a water line from the mountain to… from Jack Smith Springs, you know. So, at least they would get water from the mountain and Jack Smith Springs. Well, that it?



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, yeah, I think we've covered a lot.



PAUL BABBITT, SR.: Oh well, I should say.
