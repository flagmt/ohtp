KRISTINE PRENNACE: This is an interview with Mr. and Mrs. Bill Carson who have lived in <Flagstaff> since 1925. Mr. Carson worked for the Coconino Sun for a number of years. The interview is being conducted on July 28, 1976 at the Carsons' home, which is located at 104 E. Cedar Avenue in <Flagstaff>, by Kristine Prennace, representing the Flagstaff City Coconino County Public Library. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Mr. Carson, when and where were you born? 





BILL CARSON: Beg your pardon? 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: When and where were you born? 





BILL CARSON: Victoria County Texas. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, do you mind giving me the year, or…? 





BILL CARSON: Beg your pardon? 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you mind giving me the year? 





BILL CARSON: November 14, 1897. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: And who were your parents? 





BILL CARSON: John Wesley Carson and Lula Carson. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, Lila? 





BILL CARSON: L u l a, Lula. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: And what was her maiden name? 





BILL CARSON: Dial, D i a l. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. And what… did they come from <Texas> originally? Were they raised there or? 





BILL CARSON: Yeah, my father was born in <Bryan Texas>, and my mother was born near <Hallettsville Texas> in LaVa.a (?) county. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. And, ah, what kind of work did your father do? 





BILL CARSON: He was a farmer. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: And did your mother just help out on the farm or did she have any other kind of…? 





BILL CARSON: Well, she… no, she did the housewife, you might say, you know. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Well she went ahead after awhile and ran a boarding house. 





BILL CARSON: In her later years though she run the boarding houses, you know, here and there. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Ah. 





BILL CARSON: She run one down here where Babbitts' grocery store used to be down town there, you know. On… what's the name of that street? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Birch. 





BILL CARSON: Birch, facing Birch, that big two-story house used to be there? Right where that… the old Lee Doyle house, one of his houses. She run a boarding house there. Oh I don't know, it's been thirty some years ago, I guess. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well when did your family come to <Flagstaff> then? 





BILL CARSON: Well I came here in twenty-five. Now got off the train down there at the Overton (?). Wasn't no depot there then, just the old passenger and freight depot was together, you know, down on the east side of the Santa Fe as it went across the tracks. The depot wasn't there, then, see, that's the new depot. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. So you came in 19… did the rest of your family come then later? 





BILL CARSON: No, no. I came by myself. I came out… I had a job here with the old Coconino Sun, see. The reason why I picked this place… there was an old friend of mine, old Doc Lochmiller (?). No, he was at <Bonham Texas>. But anyway he come over. He saw me, visited me over at <Texarkana>, where I worked in the "Daily Texarkanan". I run the printing press for them. And I told him I just got a letter, a job offer from Dick (?) Coconino Sun in <Flagstaff Arizona>. And he said go there, Bill, you'll sure like that country. He says I used to, I bought lumber for the railroad, you know, at <Flagstaff>. And he said you'll sure like that country. Lots of lakes and game, you know, and such as that. And so he's the one that persuaded me, you know, to get me, so I took the train and, well I tell you about that. Old Colonel Breen, he was the editor, owner of the Coconino Sun then. And he said, "Bill, I saw the Daily Texarkanan was going to consolidate with the Four States Press", see. And they had a larger press than the one I run for them see. So I was going to be out of a job so I put a notice in the paper that publishes "Auxiliary". And I got answers from all over the country, you know. And one from old Colonel Breen, and old Doc Lochmiller said, "Bill", he said, "You're gonna last. You'll like that country." So I come here. And I wrote and told Colonel Breen that I was going to accept the job. And said they would need to… wrote and told, describe the country. Said, the way I can remember about the letter, he said, "the country's high, dry and cool". And if you like high dry and cool, and if you want a permanent job, come ahead, see. And so I come ahead, and I worked for him a good many years. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: How long did you work at the Sun? 





BILL CARSON: Well I'd say, I quit in forty-two, I believe it was. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh. 





BILL CARSON: And I worked… 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: You worked part time, you worked off and on most of the time. 





BILL CARSON: Well, it's the only job that I had, you know, was to go at that time. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Well, you were a cop for the city, and then you worked for the water department. 





BILL CARSON: Yeah, I know, but I'll come to that later on, see. And so I quit in forty-five. I just, you know, I just tired of being around that, in that old printer's ink, you know, all the time, you know. And I was afraid I was gonna get it in my… lead, lead poison, you know. And so I quit. I was gonna rest up for several weeks. And they kept a comin' after me, wanting me to go on the police force. That was just before they built the Ordnance out there, see. And so I finally went on the police force. And I worked as a police officer, one of the first one under Jim Wright. He was the head, he was the chief of police, you know, Jim Wright. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Wright? 





BILL CARSON: And I worked. And others that I worked for were Swede Johnson. He still lives over here in Doney Park. And several others, and old Philip (?) Weed a fellow by the name of Weed. I worked… he was one of the police officers. And so I worked with them until I got tired, and I changed over from them to the water department, see. And I… when they put in that pumping plant out on Lake Mary Road there, you know, well I helped run that, you know. And I was, so they shut down that spring. They had plenty water coming in from the Peaks. That's where the main… you know. And so we closed down the plant, and I'd, but I'd go out during the war, see World War II. And I'd go out there to stay at night, you know, in case of sabotage, you know. And so I was on my way back when I got hit out on that highway. (begins to cough) Excuse me now, I shouldn't talk any more. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. 





BILL CARSON: I hate to talk about that, because I never will be well, you see. (Becomes emotional.) 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. 





BILL CARSON: Right after the war started, you know, World War II, and they built that Ordnance out there, you know. And they had a bunch of colored soldiers coming in here from down below, you know. I think they finally got… called them the "Buffalo Soldiers" or something like that. Anyway a bunch of them come in. And we'd have a time with them, because they'd come to town, you know. They stayed out at this Ordnance, you know. They had a regular camp out there, you see. And they'd come down town and have a big old pistol hooked around their belts, around. We had a time a keepin' them, taking their guns away from them, you know and one thing and another. But they were good-natured about it, you know. We didn't have any trouble with any of them. That's one thing that I can say. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did they stay long? Just as long as the depot was going, or…? 





BILL CARSON: Well they stayed there, it was on account of the… during the war, you know, as guards out there, you know, on account of sabotage and one thing and another when they was building that Ordnance. Otherwise I don't know, maybe you can find out from somebody else more about that, you know, what they were here for. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, well that's good. I'm glad you mentioned them, though. That's interesting. 





BILL CARSON: Oh, them old time officers, though, they've been gone or died off. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Well Swede Johnson was nobody (?) when we… 





BILL CARSON: Yeah, he was one of them when them Niger soldiers was here, you know, that's come in. The thing about… we pumped that water out of that Lake, Lake Mary and unfiltered (?) it you see and treated it. And then it pumped into town in the city main, see. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now when did they start using Lake Mary as the water source? 





BILL CARSON: Well that was, oh I can't tell you the exact date, but it was along in the late thirties, I imagine, wasn't it Freda? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: I guess so. And then later on they filled the upper dam, you see. That was first, the lower lake. 





BILL CARSON: That was before they built the upper dam, you know. We got the water out of the lower dam there. If you remember going down, you know, where that lower dam is, you see that little building down just below it? Well that's where the pump house was. And after a good many years later then, they moved the pump house over across the other side of the lake, see. A pipeline that come down from the upper lake, see, it went through it and then back to the city main. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, but they didn't start using that until probably the late thirties, early forties around there. 





BILL CARSON: When they built that upper dam, then they quit pumping water out of the lower lake then. Except they pumped some to keep the, pumps, you know, running or keep things in shape, but they didn't use the water much out of the lower lake anymore after they built the upper dam, see. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: They built the upper dam around thirty-six, or seven or eight, because Marian was born in thirty-eight, and the dam was there before Marian was born, the upper dam. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, so that's… it's good to have kind of a date on that. And before that, they just used the spring water then from up on the Peaks. 





BILL CARSON: Yes, from <Little Springs> from up on the mountain there, see. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Except when they had to bring in water. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, one dry year? 





BILL CARSON: Yeah __________. They hauled the water in here from <Ash Fork>, south <Ash Fork>. What's the name of that spring down there? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Del Rio, I think or… 





BILL CARSON: What's the name of that little station on the railroad down at <Chino Valley>? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: I think it's Del Rio. 





BILL CARSON: What's the name of them springs in there where they pump… <Ash Fork>, I think? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Del Rio. 





BILL CARSON: Del Rio Springs, yeah, Del Rio. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: And so they had to haul all the way in from there. 





BILL CARSON: They brought it in rail road, you know. Brought it in, in big cars. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: MM. Was that in the thirties, also? 





BILL CARSON: Beg your pardon? 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was that in the thirties or before that? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: They've had it even since then. I remember one time they brought in a bunch of water dogs in it (all laugh) and made us all sick. 





BILL CARSON: We didn't have much snow up on the mountain, you know, and we'd run out of water along late in the summer, you know, and then they'd have to haul the water in from Del Rio Springs. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: They had water dogs? 





BILL CARSON: Well we thought, we thought they were water dogs. I don't know that they were. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: They even had the water dogs caught in their meters. I don't know. 





BILL CARSON: Anyway the water was full of that old green moss and stuff, you know. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Clogged up? 





BILL CARSON: But it was treated. They treated it, you know, before they… It was wholesome, you know. It wasn't, it wouldn't hurt us to drink it. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now when you worked for the police department, was that the first police department the city had? 





BILL CARSON: Well, no, the first one… what was that first policeman, officer? I forget names, you know.



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Well there was Parsons. 





BILL CARSON: Yeah Parsons, Jim Parsons. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: It wasn't Jim, I don't think. But you can get that stuff from, you know, like the Johnsons (?), or something like that, they could… 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: So they just have a town Marshall or something, before they had the actual police department? 





BILL CARSON: Yeah. That, and one of them, I can tell you where he lived. What's…? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: A fellow by the name of Cooper. 





BILL CARSON: Yeah, a fellow by the name of Cooper was the town marshall, see. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Oh ah, excuse me, but, ah, have you contacted Weidner? 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Howard. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh, they did. 





BILL CARSON: Weidner, I mean, ah Hayes Weidner was a water superintendent, you know. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh uh huh. 





BILL CARSON: And his boy, what was his…? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Howard. 





BILL CARSON: Howard and Jim Beard and I and Herman Dunnam. We worked for the water department, see, out at the pumping plant. And Howard (?) used to read meters and once in awhile they'd tell me to help him read meters, you know, but not very often, water meters, you know. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Were the meters pretty much the same as they are now? 





BILL CARSON: No, well yes, some of them, the old ones were quite a bit different. But the ones that they've been put in since then, or anybody can read them, you know, what I mean, they're easy to read. But the other was sort of like these electric meters, you know. They're quite a bit different. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh, a little more complicated. 





BILL CARSON: Yeah something like that I don’t remember now. Anyway that last meter they put in, anybody can read them, you know. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Why don't I ask you, when did you get married? 





BILL CARSON: (Laughs) You ask her now. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: In twenty-nine. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh. 





BILL CARSON: September the fourteenth, wasn't it Freda? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: No, October twenty-first. 





BILL CARSON: Put on that "twenty-first". Now she always told me everything that happened to me was on the fourteenth, you know. That's when I was born and when Marian was born, my daughter, and things that way, though. Yeah I remember now it was the twenty-first of September. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: October. 





BILL CARSON: October? It was right after deer season started. (All laugh.) 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh that's a good way to remember. And what is your maiden name? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Severnson(?) 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh Freda Severnson? And where did you come from? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: I was born in <Hyrum Utah>. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: And, ah… 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: But I didn't grow up there. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, what part of the country did you grow up in? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: <Oregon> and <Washington>, beautiful… 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: And then when did you come to <Flagstaff>? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Oh I think it was twenty-eight. I came up to go to summer school. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh. 





BILL CARSON: The reason why she came to teacher's college here. The year that… the summer that the University of Arizona had their summer session here at the teacher's college, see. And Freda come up. Ask her more about that see. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, okay. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: I wasn't much for college. 





BILL CARSON: She finished her degree there. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Well I finished my work is all. 





BILL CARSON: At this college, you know. It was a teacher's college, normal school or whatever you call it. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. You were going to college then at that time, working towards a degree? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Yeah, I was working towards a degree. Got a Bachelor's of Science from Washington State. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: In education? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: No it was in horticulture, I guess you'd call it. It was agricultural. You see I studied to be a landscape gardener, but I never got anywhere with it. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh. So you never went ahead and got a job? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: No. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: You got married instead. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: I had plenty of job then. No, we bought a place in thirty-one. We bought a place out five miles from town. It was five miles from town then, but now it's right in town, see. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, in east <Flagstaff>? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Uh huh. 





BILL CARSON: The other side of east <Flagstaff>. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: And, ah, we raised chickens. And I didn't know a thing about a chicken except that they had two legs and wings. (All laugh.) 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: And they are a little contrary. 





BILL CARSON: And they had gizzards. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Oh, Bill can make things grow, but I can't, so I've sure picked the wrong kind of a job in my life. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: So you had like a ranch, was it? How large? 





BILL CARSON: Beg your pardon? 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: How large a place did you have? 





BILL CARSON: Oh, it only had one acre of land or ground, right on the highway, see. And I worked, I drove in and out of town, you see. Before we bought the place, I asked old Colonel Breen about where should I… I wanted to get out in the country, you know, live, 'cause I was raised on the farm, you know. And all he says, well go out east of here, he said, don't buy anything anywhere south or west, on account of that old black mud, you know what I mean, that soil. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh. 





BILL CARSON: Said go out east of here. He says that's the coming country. Well you can see how it is a coming. Colonel Breen, he was a… he come to <Arizona> as the first forest supervisor of the Coconino National Forest, you see. The first one. He was appointed by some president, you know, to come out here. He was from back east. He's been dead a good many years now. Well Jim Beard was his nephew. And Jim, he had brothers and sisters, they was raised right here in <Flagstaff>. If you can get hold of him I don't know how you could, but you could see Herman Dunnam. You probably know him, don't you? 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: I… yeah I've had contact with him. 





BILL CARSON: Yeah, well he can tell where Jim is, I guess. I think he's down in either… well he comes up here in the summertime. He works for the city water department, you know, nearly every summer. He can tell you more about that <San Francisco Peaks> than the geologist can, see. He knows more about that them Peaks than anybody, because he's been all over them, you know, testing for water, you know. The water, you know. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh, yeah he'd be a good person to contact then. I'll try and get ahold of him. So you maintained your place out east of town… for quite awhile? 





BILL CARSON: Yeah we lived out there thirty-four years. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh goodness, uh huh. That's great. Now what was that part of town like? 





BILL CARSON: Well there wasn't nothing between. There was just a few houses in Sunnyside. That's before there wasn't even any store there, see, anything like that. And ah, well the Museum Club was there. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh? 





BILL CARSON: Maybe you know where it is. It's one of the first. It was quite a ways beyond there. That's where I got hit by a car, you know, there in front of the Museum Club. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh. 





BILL CARSON: I was going to work. My car had got out of shape, and I had to walk into the city to take a city truck. You know, they had to use their trucks during the war there, you know, and they was short of vehicles, you know. Well I'd take their truck and drive out to the plant there, you see, to spend the night. And then I'd come back in the morning and leave the truck, and then I'd get my car and go home. But that time my car was out of shape, you know, and I had it in the garage, and I had to walk home. And coming back that evening, that's when I got hit out on the highway, oh around four or five o'clock in the evening. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: That's when you were going in to work. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh. That was really bad. So there just wasn't anything out there as far as… Was Fourth Street there, was there anything like Fourth Street? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Yeah there was a street went up there ended up at a fox farm. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh. 





BILL CARSON: There was a water company out there that didn't belong to the city. But it was the Greenlaw Water Company, you know. The Greenlaw sawmill was across the road from where our house was. Well of course there was nothing left there but the old corrals when we bought out there see. But they had been there. They got their water from the city, but the city didn't own it, you know, they just bought their water from the city. And it run clear on down, all the way through there. And then the light company come in there quite a few years later. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was that in the thirties that the electric company came in? 





BILL CARSON: Yeah. It was sometime… old George Harrington. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: It was just about the time Marian was born was when we got that electricity went out. Well anyway it was some fellow who had bought some… oh, what's Barker Village now? And ah, it was during the Depression, and so, ah, some fellow asked another fellow and Bill to dig some postholes, and then… so he could get electricity at his place. And then he helped to bring it on farther out. Well it got just as far as Barker's Village. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh yeah. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Somebody had pulled a fast one on them, but… 





BILL CARSON: Well there's only the few. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Anyhow the light company put it out 





BILL CARSON: Old Ralph, I mean ah, Ralph Dickinson. And, ah, he was one of the old settlers here, you know, Ralph Dickinson. Olf, O l f, Olf Dickinson… what's the name of his partner? Al Beasely. They was the one that started Sunnyside, see. Well they had me to go out there and help them on the pipeline to put water into Sunnyside, see. That's when I, I took a trip down in <Texas>, and I come back, and I was waiting to go back on the Sun, you know. And I went out and helped them a little on that pipeline, see. And then a week or so, I don't know, several days anyway I went back working on the Sun for a good many years after that. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Ah, so you didn't have any electricity or water? 





BILL CARSON: No we didn't have, we had a big cistern. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: No we didn't either, we had it in barrels. 





BILL CARSON: We hauled water out in the barrels, see. And then I built a big cistern with a pump, hand pump, you know, on it. Well it held several hundred gallons, several thousand gallons of water, you know. It was a good outfit. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Until it quit raining. (all laugh) 





BILL CARSON: And then after the electricity come then, I got electric pump on there. And it had electric running water in the house, and then like all they need to do is open the faucet and the water'd run just like the faucet does, you know, from the city pressure, you know. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Well that was great then, I bet. 





BILL CARSON: I'll say. And we would use old… for lights, you know, we'd use old… I guess it's hanging up out there in the garage yet, that old electric lantern, that old oil, kero… 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: That gas lantern. 





BILL CARSON: The old gasoline lamp you know. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: We used kerosene. 





BILL CARSON: Kerosene lamp. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Bill's brother-in-law, he loaned us a gas, one of those gas outfits. I was always a little scared of those things. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, yeah. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: _____________ so we got rid of those things. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you have, like a wood stove to cook on? 





BILL CARSON: Yeah. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: We used wood stove. 





BILL CARSON: And then finally when they got the gas line… went through of it, I hooked on to it, and then we fixed the old cook stove up, 'til it burned gas, you know. And so we had gas that heat the whole house, you know.



 



FRIEDA CARSON: I preferred the wood much more. C: Yeah, but we burnt wood part of the time, too, you know. But we'd go out and haul wood from down in the cedars, down in the junipers. The other side of <Winona>, we'd haul the wood in, you know, from the… pinion and juniper. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Ah, was Doney Park developed much? 





BILL CARSON: Beg your pardon? 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was there anything out in the Doney Park area? 





BILL CARSON: Well, just them old farms is all. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Some old homes? 





BILL CARSON: Yeah that was before the airport was put in there, too, you know. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh, Koch Field? 





BILL CARSON: Yeah, Koch Field. Just them farms in there, then. You know when I took up farms census in thirty-five, well ah, where the airport went in, well that was a big old wheat field, see, and bean field. And then Pipers… Pipers are still living around there, you know. We'd got a nephew who lives in there, too, now, what I mean, he works for the highway. He brought a few little acreage from them, you know, and he's been a working for the highway a good many years. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: So the Pipers were out there then? 





BILL CARSON: Beg your pardon? 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: The Pipers were out there. 





BILL CARSON: Oh yeah, old man Piper. Well right before you turn towards where the airport is, that road that goes straight on, that goes into the old Piper place, see, I guess. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Have you talked with any of the Pipers? 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: I haven't been able to get in touch with them yet. 





BILL CARSON: They're not in the city limits so I don't know. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Ah, Bertha is gone (?), but she… you know, they came here, I don't know… when she was a girl. She remembered though when she lived in <Kansas>. Her father was on the railroad. 





BILL CARSON: Them old ranches, that was all homesteaded you know. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Bertha Brandis lives on eighty-nine, you know, before you go up the hill. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh yeah, okay, you're right. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Just before you go up the hill to go into Deadman's… 





BILL CARSON: Just before you go up the hill, you know, that farm to the left. That's old Monroe (?) place left, Brandis had bought that, and Bertha, they bought it a good many years ago, and they've been a living on it, and the old Brandis place… 



 



END TAPE I, SIDE I, BEGIN TAPE 1, SIDE 2 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well, maybe you can talk about the downtown area. 





BILL CARSON: About what? 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: The downtown area, what it was like. 





BILL CARSON: Well I don't know, that's many new places in there now, I get lost when I go downtown, you know. I can't seem to hardly tell where I'm at. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: The Coconino Sun, when he first worked for it, was where the Monte Vista Hotel is now. 





BILL CARSON: Across, yeah. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: It was across from there, or it was right there? 





BILL CARSON: No. When I first come here, well the old Coconino Sun building was in a little building, a little shack like right where that Monte Vista Hotel is, where that barber shop is on Aspen Avenue, where the alley goes through there, well right to the left, like you're going towards north, that's where the Coconino Sun building was. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. 





BILL CARSON: And to the right of it was the Wilson-Coffin Plumbing shop, see. It's all different now, they just built that building. And that Coffin, Paul Coffin, he had a garage on the corner there on Aspen and… what's the name of that, Verde wasn't it? 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Or Agassiz. 





BILL CARSON: Agassiz, or something like there. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Now where was that, that Whipple Undertaking Parlor, now was it always been there? 





BILL CARSON: That's along Aspen ain't it? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: That's along Aspen there just across from Mom Power's had her hat shop. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh. Now she was right down there in that section of Aspen. 





BILL CARSON: Mom Powers was just about at the old Coconino Sun building in back of… that's Colonel Breen, he owned that drug store, you know, Moore Drug, you know, Moore Drug. You know where it is? Well that was… that's old, it was in there… Breen and Moore was the name of it, but it belonged to Breen. But Moore was the druggist in it, see, and he finally bought him out, you know, later. And that building on down Aspen, just toward Aspen, I think there's a billiards parlor. Oh, I forget now what kind of building it is. And the old web (?) press down in the basement under that. See, I run that there for a long time, that is after they built that. 



 



In twenty-six, they decided they'd build a new home for the Coconino Sun, and they was going move into it, you know. Well I'd been into one of them moving cases before, you know, and I knew what it was. I worked for a newspaper that moved, tore that old press down and moved it off a couple hundred miles and set it up again, and I didn't want anymore of that see. So I took off and went down <Texas> where my people were. My father and mother were down at <Corpus Christi Texas>, then. I went on down there and visited them, drove an old Model T Ford out of <Flagstaff>. And they was just paving the road out between here and <Winona>, you know what I mean. And the old ruts down through that gravel, that they were putting there before they oiled it, you know. And I think I had three punctures between here and <Winslow>. Just piece of sticks in them old hard-pressed (?) tires in that old Model T, you know. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: So the roads were really bad. 





BILL CARSON: Well, when I come back then they'd finished that most of the way, as far as <Winona>, I think it was. And then gravel road from then on. Of course, that lower country down there never was really bad like it is. Never had much snow down the other side of <Winona>, you know. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Right. So then the Sun had moved by the time you came back? 





BILL CARSON: Yeah, they'd all moved and re-set the press. But they didn't have it in good working order see. I had a time getting it back in to where I could turn that switch and it start to rolling off, and put the papers out without any trouble, you see. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Where was the new building then? 





BILL CARSON: Well it was just across the street from the old building. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, oh. 





BILL CARSON: Well you know back on Aspen that big building along from Moore Drug, down towards the alley there, you know, that's the old Coconino Sun building. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Just moved across the street. 





BILL CARSON: Uh huh. That big brick building, or cinder block, or what is it? Brick I think. That was before they had cinder block. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: But where was the original, was on the north side? 





BILL CARSON: Huh? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: The original was on the north side of Aspen. And, ah, the Coconino Sun then was on the south side of Aspen. 





BILL CARSON: Yes. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: And, ah, Whipple's Undertaking Parlor was… 





BILL CARSON: I don't know anything about the under parlor. The milk depot was on San Francisco Street, just this side of. Moore Drug faces on San Francisco Street, don't it? Well back of that is where the old Sun building… see, Colonel Breen owned all that and the old milk depot, that next building next to it, well he owned that building, too, you see. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: It was on San Francisco. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh, yeah, right down there. Ah, were there a lot… was Front Street still pretty…? 





BILL CARSON: What? 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was Front Street still pretty rough when you came? 





BILL CARSON: Well, it seemed to me like there, I'm not sure, I don't remember about whether they paved any of it at all or not. It wasn't, Aspen, you know wasn't paved. But Aspen, San Francisco Street, I mean Santa Fe Avenue, it was paved. And Aspen Avenue, seems to me like it and Birch… I'm not sure about it, but they paved them first. They the first ones that was paved, you know. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any of the people that ah, oh personalities around the town very well, like do you remember Bucko Sisk (?)? 





BILL CARSON: Who? 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Bucko Sisk (?)? 





BILL CARSON: No, I remember that name, but I don't remember him personally, see. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Is there anyone else that you can remember real well? 





BILL CARSON: Who? 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Any one else that you remember? 





BILL CARSON: Well, you know, the old timers I remember good and well. All the Babbitts, you know. And old man C.J. and Joe Babbitt. Joe Babbitt and I used to go out together out to the woods, you know, way out. Went hunting and all that kind of stuff, you know. Not young Joe, you know, the lawyer, his father. And oh I don't know. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: You knew a lot of people. 





BILL CARSON: Well of course I did. Like me I can't call their names right off, you know. Most of them is either dead or gone, you know. Moved away from here. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you know Lee Doyle? 





BILL CARSON: Oh yes. Well, like I said, my mother lived in the old Doyle house, you know. But Babbitt bought that whole block along there, you know, before they built that Thriftway, Babbitt Thriftway, you know. They had Babbitt Thriftway 1. Babbitt Thriftway 2 was over on San Francisco on the corner across the street from that… well there's a saloon there now; that was Babbitt Thriftway 3. And when I'd get off from the Sun, I'd go through the back door, and I'd go to San Francisco Street and the back end of the grocery store to get my groceries, you know. And then get in the car and go home. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah. Let's see, you did a lot of hunting in this area didn't you? 





BILL CARSON: Yeah. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you have to go very far out of town to go hunting? 





BILL CARSON: No. Well yeah, we did naturally, the best hunting grounds, you know, were quite a ways out. But we've seen deer, you know, grazing over towards Elden Mountain right where we lived out on… it was eighty-nine and sixty-six. Well we could see deer grazing off over there towards the mountain, you know. And things that way then. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was there any game like in Switzer's Canyon? 





BILL CARSON: No, not up and down here, I never knew _______ too close. This street here and that one over hill, that wasn't there then, and I rode up and down the Switzer Canyon. It wasn't there then, you know. It was just when it come a big rain… I remember I had to walk along real slow, water'd be running on the highway down there, you know, coming down. That is when there's a lot of snow, early in the spring in a thaw, then it comes some rain, that water'd run on the highway, clear down under the railroad there and way up high on the railroad. I've seen all them buildings down there just this side… I've seen that all under water under there, see. And I always wondered if that ain't going to happen again someday. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah. 





BILL CARSON: You'd see a big lake. Water just as far it could up Switzer Canyon from sixty-six there see. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: It would flood all in that area. Was there very much flooding in other parts of the city? 





BILL CARSON: Well the… after they built the underpass there… see there wasn't no underpass there then, they just, they only had one crossing. They had a crossing further on down. But they didn't use it much, you know. And across there on San Francisco Street, that was the only… oh yeah, and at the end of Beaver, you know. Two crossings, they had to use them. That was before they put the underpass down. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Yeah a lot of those streets… 





BILL CARSON: Under the railroad, see. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: When we had a rain, I think almost all of Santa Fe would be under water, wouldn't it, and out at Sunnyside, there was, you know, a lot of water running across there. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh. 





BILL CARSON: There wasn't much flooding. There would be slides (?) come down through town, but there wasn't much flooding, because people didn't use it. What I mean, they let the water run on through there, bridges where they needed them, you know. And that was all. Maybe the water would be up a little high and run over, but they'd have to wait until the water went down or something that way, you know. But there wasn't any flood trouble that I can remember. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: But we had a lot more rain years ago than we do now. And, ah, a lot of the roads, you know, water'd be rushing across. Well of course Sunnyside's so filled up now I don't know if it'll get past the houses or not. 





BILL CARSON: No, same on south and west side of <Flagstaff>, too. It's built up a lot more than when it was then, you know. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, it's quite a bit different. Now, let me see. Were there any big fires that you can remember in <Flagstaff>? 





BILL CARSON: No, not that I can remember. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was the Greenlaw mill still out there when you came? 





BILL CARSON: Yeah the Greenlaw mill was there. They'd sold out. Oh, you mean out, no they'd moved the machinery out. The old building was still there. And the kids' stables where the kids kept their horses and stuff, you know, was still there. But the mill part was gone. But there was another fellow put a little sawmill up the road a little bit farther. And he run it there for several years. And he went broke, I guess, I don't know, anyway. What was the name of that fellow who had that little sawmill out across there? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: He was right close to where we were. 





BILL CARSON: He was across the road from where we lived. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: I remember some kind of an outfit standing there when we moved out there. And I think there was a church out there. 





BILL CARSON: What? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: I think there was a church out there before we moved out. 





BILL CARSON: What kind of shop? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: And they moved. 





BILL CARSON: What kind of…? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: A church. There was a church out there some where. 





BILL CARSON: Oh yeah, that's right, too. There's some kind of meeting house. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh. They use it just like in the summer? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: They use it, as convention, a convention outfit was always there. 





BILL CARSON: But that was way back this side of Twin Peaks. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Still there. 





BILL CARSON: And it's still there. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: But they had another kind of a church there, I think. I'm not sure about that. I didn't… 





BILL CARSON: But there wasn't hardly any, just a few houses in Sunnyside. And I remember be going in to work in the summertime, right afternoon, you know, I'd drive in and out, drive home to eat lunch and then back to work. I'd have to wait until that water coming down Fourth Street, that's why they had to put Fourth Street through there. I remember that water'd be coming down over that highway. And I'd have to stop and wait 'til the water run down before I could cross. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any, ah, big snows? 





BILL CARSON: Yes. I had a picture, they showed me a picture about nineteen and twenty something, the old Coconino Sun, they used show me some pictures about out in front of the old Coconino Sun. You couldn't… the snow piled up so high, you couldn't see cars passing, you see. Well, I've seen it right here, after we moved here, ten or eleven years ago, I've seen it snow piled up so high along here we couldn't see the cars going up and down the street, you know. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: So you have had some bad ones. 





BILL CARSON: But them days… somewhere along about in the early twenties, when was it we had that big… forty-four, was it, when we had that first big snowstorm. Wasn't that forty-four, forty-eight wasn't it… forty-seven or eight? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: There was one in thirty-nine. I thought maybe I had a picture of it, but I don't know just which box it's in. It was thirty-eight or somewhere around there. No. 





BILL CARSON: And old lady, Winifred Lynch, she owned that farm right in there, you know what I mean. I farmed it one year for her, you know; farmed that land. Well it… I don't know, I had quite a crop. And said I'd made the best crop there she'd ever made. I don't know… raised corn, I don't know, thirty or forty acres of corn. And we had piled up the old garage and everything else. The only place I had to pile in, and then I had to give… she got a certain part of it, a third, a fourth or something like that. We had enough corn to feed our chickens for years and years left of that, you know. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: That was a… what was her name? 





BILL CARSON: Lynch, Winifred Lynch. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Lynch. 





BILL CARSON: The old Lynch place, still listed in the city directory, you know; what I mean in the street outfit. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh uh huh, uh huh. Um let me see here. Now you were here then during the Depression, then? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: We were married just before the Depression. 





BILL CARSON: Yeah, I'll say we were. That's when we got laid off. That was one time I wasn't working for the Coconino Sun, 'cause they laid me off, 'cause they printed, you know I was the only pressman they had. And the printers, they were union men, see. No I was the union pressman, but they were printers, and they were union printers, you know. And then they laid me off, and they done my presswork. See that's how the union business works. When I come here, I belonged to the Printer's Union; I mean the Pressman's Union, see. But they'd lay me off. But they'd get a little tight, they'd lay me off, you know, and they'd do the presswork. But when they'd get a lot of work, then they'd have to call me back in, you see. Of course I didn't care much, because I didn't want to stay in that printing shop all the time anyway, you know. 



(looking at photographs?) 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Here's another old timer. But that isn't _________ as some of them were. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Now this is a paper, the Coconino Sun was right in here, you see. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Sure it's just right behind there. I think the health spa's in there now.



 



FRIEDA CARSON: It might be. I don't go to town much. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Um let me see. Oh, so what… you did just odd jobs then? 





BILL CARSON: Well, didn't hardly, hardly that. I done my own farm work, you know, and such as that. And we had, most of our living was off the chickens, you know, and such as that, you know. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yes, so that kept you going. 





BILL CARSON: And I'd go fishing, you know (laughs), or something that way. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. But it was pretty hard times anyway? 





BILL CARSON: Yeah. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah. Ah, let me see. Do you remember were there many Mexican-American families in town? 





BILL CARSON: Yeah, sure, south of the tracks, you know. There wasn't very many Spanish people on this side of the railroad, you know. But one of my helpers on the Coconino Sun by the name of Rodriguez, Raymond Rodriguez, he was a young fellow. And his aunt lived just back of the courthouse there then, up the hill there from the courthouse, that's all been tore in. Now there was a house there that she lived in back of the courthouse. That's where his aunt lived. He lived there with his aunt. He had the mumps, you know. And I didn't know what had happened, and I went in to visit. I knew he didn't come to work that day, and I went in to see him, you know. And that's when I caught the mumps, too, you know. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh no. 





BILL CARSON: And so I was staying at the Pine Hotel then. That was before I was married. I lived there at the Pine Hotel. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh. What was the Pine Hotel like? 





BILL CARSON: Well it was… most kinds of people all over the country, you know, they'd come to town. And they'd put up, get a room at Pine Hotel. Old man Alf Dickinson, he ran the Pine Hotel. And he was known all over the country, you know. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Was it nice? Was it fairly nice? 





BILL CARSON: Oh yes, sure it was a good place a good clean place. That Dickinson family lived there in the hotel, too, you know. So you know it was all right, you know. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Was there a place to eat there, or…? 





BILL CARSON: No. No I'd go up the street. I'd eat at a restaurant. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Was it a little Chinese restaurant? 





BILL CARSON: There was one there. Yes, there was one there up along on Santa Fe Avenue there some where. I don't remember now. And then there was another one, too, just between, between the Pine Hotel and the corner of Aspen, of San Francisco Street. In between that, they opened up a restaurant, and between it and the old Thriftway 3, Babbitts' Thriftway 2 or 3, I forget now which. Then they built the one out… they called that… I forget now. Anyway it was the Greenlaw Thriftway; I believe what they named it. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh, yeah, out there. 





BILL CARSON: But the old Greenlaw sawmill that was a couple of miles further on, on old 89. 'Course 66 and 89 was together. They parted there at Townsend, Townsend store. And there wasn't no 66, went on towards <Winslow>, and 89, wasn't 89 A then, that was 89, see, it went on north towards <Utah>, see. But there wasn't no 66. They built that 66… oh I forget now what year it was, but quite a bit later. It turned off there this side of, where that road that comes in from… well I can't explain it. But dad gum it, they've got things so different down there. I dread driving down town anymore, you know, on account of getting lost. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yes, so different. Now let me see. Were there many tourists? 





BILL CARSON: Beg your pardon? 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were there many tourists that came to town? 





BILL CARSON: Yes. There was quite a few tourists. Well I can't tell you too much about the tourists, you know, because we didn't have any contact with them, you know. We lived out on the farm for all them years, you see, most of the years. See we just bought this place here in sixty-five, wasn't it when we bought this place here? It was a brand new house, just been built, and we moved right into it, you know, as soon as they finished building it. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well, were there many people, well in sixty-five there, were people around in this area? Were there many homes in this area? 





BILL CARSON: Yes. Them two houses here, you know, they were moved in here from <Jerome>. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh. 





BILL CARSON: Yeah, this house and the one down on the other side. This fellow, he don't live here now, he's re-building it, you know, he’s going to move in, trying to get it built so he can… he works out in the woods, see. Trying to get it so they can move in it before winter, you know, and be our neighbors. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh. But they moved those houses from Jerome then? 





BILL CARSON: Yeah. And the other, Ed Eyrich, R i c h, E r i c h, he lives in the next house there. He works for the sawmill, see. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Let me see. Oh did you ever go to the <Grand Canyon> when you first got here? 





BILL CARSON: Yeah, we used to. Friends would come in, you know, kin folks from back east, you know, come in and visit, you know. We'd take them over to <Grand Canyon>, you know to show it them. Oh we've been over there, I guess half a dozen or more times, you know. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was it quite a bit different when you first saw it than, now? 





BILL CARSON: Well that was before they had that road that come in from the west, from the east, you know, that turned off this side of Cameron, you know. Well that was before that road was put through there. I believe we've been over that road once or twice, to, since it's been put in. But there never was an awful lot of traffic on it that I remember. It was paved… no it wasn't paved when we first turned off. The first time we went to <Grand Canyon>, it turned off there at <Bellemont>. What's the name of that road, Freda, that went on towards the Spring Valley and then into… towards the <Grand Canyon>? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: You could always go by the way of <Cameron>, you know. You go to the north and then turn off there by… 





BILL CARSON: No. I'm talking about west of here. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Yeah, you turn off there about where <Parks> is. 





BILL CARSON: Yeah, there at <Parks>, we went north, see, to <Grand Canyon>. That was before they built that paved road, you know, from this side of <Williams> through there, you see. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh, yeah. So it was all dirt. It must have been a pretty rough ride. 





BILL CARSON: It was, sure enough. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Well, it was they… I don't know just when they did fix that road out there on 89. I remember going across that when it was, you know, gravel. 





BILL CARSON: That was before, I remember stopping, you know, and picking up petrified wood, you know. There at… it turns off about a mile this side of <Cameron>. And goes back west, you know, and follows the rim of the <Grand Canyon>, you know, for quite a ways there. I remember before we started up high, well that little dunes all around there were covered with petrified wood, you know. And I remember several times stopping. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Well, I mean 89 wasn't paved until somewheres in the thirties. And, ah, when they built that road, ah, bridge across, the Navajo Bridge, that was still… it was all, still was gravel a pretty rough road. 





BILL CARSON: We used to go up there to <Lee's Ferry>, you know, fishing. That was before they built that upper dam, you know. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Before they built <Page>. It's that dam there at <Page>. 





BILL CARSON: And before they paved that road, when they paved that road then, well that road that went over the hill, the other side of Brandis' place, this side, well right down in Deadman Flat, well that road followed… went through the edge of Bonita Park. You remember do you know where Bonita Park is? 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh uh. 





BILL CARSON: Well that's that park turning towards Sunset Crater. That park back in there, it's a farm like, looked like a farm, well that's Bonita Park. Well, the old road went through, right to the top of the hill, and went down to the edge of that park, and then on down the canyon. The new road, when they paved it, see they built that new road, as such through there, down in what we call Deadman Flat. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Did you ever go down to <Oak Creek>? 





BILL CARSON: Oh yes. That was before they built that… 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: It was gravel. 





BILL CARSON: Before they paved that upper Oak Creek road, you know. We went mostly down Schnebly Hill road see. It was a better road than this one down the hill, you know, on account of you had to wait then, so many curves, you know. Couldn't hardly pass people. And following that road on down the creek is… I don't know, we liked to go down Schnebly Hill the best, you know. I remember went down there once with fellow by the name of Woodruff. He worked there at the Coconino Sun. Him and his wife and a little boy went down there in the car, and coming back up his car got real hot, you know. And it stopped, let it boiled over, you know. And let it cool off, and he started up again, and he killed his motor. He didn't have no brake, and it started rolling back you know, down that hill. And I grabbed that little boy and throwed him out against the bank, and I jumped out. He whirled the wheel around and butted it right against the end of the wall, you know, in the cliff there. And we had to sit there and wait until somebody come and wanted by, see, because he had the road blocked, see. And they had to help us pull it, you know, man power, you know. Pull it back in the road so he could come on up the hill. But I never will forget that little old boy. He was scared, and I was, too. I was a little bit rough, I imagine. Anyway I throwed him out, and he hit the ground bouncing, went to squalling, you know. But he wasn't hurt any, you know. It just scared him. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah. 





BILL CARSON: But him and his wife was in the front seat, you know. And boy howdy they surely hit… 



 



END TAPE 1, SIDE 2, BEGIN TAPE 2, SIDE 1 





BILL CARSON: I didn't hear it (?). 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: That was sixty-seven, I think, when we had that happen. 





BILL CARSON: Yeah, sixty-seven that’s when we lived… 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Now, year before last, or a couple of years ago, we had really big storm, but it would melt in between times. And ah I had spade the garden. I was going to have a nice garden. And you know it all melted, formed ice, and it just had that ground packed. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah. So it's about every ten years that we get a big snow. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Well it was just a few years ago that we had a big snow, but then it melted in between. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, right. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: And you didn't notice it so much. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: But it's those big ones that come all within a few days that stay so long. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: I think we had that in sixty-seven, we had one. 





BILL CARSON: It usually starts snowing late in the afternoon, you know. It snowed on maybe… some of them storms last as many as three days, see. And then it'd clear off, and we'd have sunshine, you know, for three or four or maybe a week. And it'd melt everything down pretty good, you know, and then it'd come another one, that's why, you know, it went in cycles, you know. About every week we'd have a storm and every other week, about every other week we'd have a storm and about two weeks between them we'd have sunshine, you know. So the country never was closed up very long except that one time. And I remember out at the old place, them snow gos (?) [snowmobiles], when they first had them snow gos (?) they call them, motors in all of them, and they'd go… all went through the woods, you know. And we'd see them. The fence posts was all, all the fences right on the pastures, you know. Hell, you couldn't tell where the fence was. It was all covered with snow, you know. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: It's not a Snow Go. It's a weasel, I think they call it. You know, they were on top the ground, and they'd, they were weasels, in them days and now they call the… 





BILL CARSON: Well remember out at the old place there… 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Snowmobiles, but they are a little bit smaller than those weasels were. But ah, we did have snow, maybe almost as high as the fence post. I was trying to find a picture of where it was as high as a fence post, and the woodshed was all. But I can't seem to locate the picture. 





BILL CARSON: Marian had her snow off the wood she’d, the roof of the wood shed's always slick, sloped off a little ways, and then down, you know, about, oh, quite a bit higher than the house. And she'd get up there and try to snow slide, you know… her sled, you know, and she'd ride it down that snow bank, you know. She had it just like the Snow Bowl up there, except it was a lot smaller, you know. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: The snow had the washer line covered up so she'd go right across it, and across the fence. It was on the other side. 





BILL CARSON: One thing I want to tell you about, you know, about our daughter. She, the only child we have, you know. And she was born here at <Flagstaff>. And she graduated Flagstaff High School and then through that Arizona State College, you know. It was Arizona State College, then, it wasn't a university. And then she went from there to Rutgers in <New Jersey>. And she got her Master's degree there. And then she went from there to Kansas University. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Then she went down to <Maryland> and then to <Kansas>. 





BILL CARSON: Well she taught there at Maryland University. Taught there two years, I believe it was. And then she went there to get her doctor's degree in Kansas University. But she didn't quite make it until… 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Her health broke on her. 





BILL CARSON: They had trouble there in the college, you know, on account of her professor, the head of her department, you know, he got mad and quit, you know, and left her without… her and all the rest the kids, they didn't get to finish their work. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: She could have gone down to <Lubbock> with him but she didn't. By that time she already knew that he wasn't too hot so she didn't go. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: So she's just short. Did she ever get her doctorate? 





BILL CARSON: No, she finally… 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: No she never has. Now she's up in <Michigan>. She thinks that maybe she can teach up there. 





BILL CARSON: Yeah, but she married, she married a fellow from the University of Kansas. She met a fellow there; she married him. And then she lives in <Michigan>, now; they do. And he's getting his doctor's degree in computers, you know, at Wayne State University in <Detroit Michigan>. And then he's working now between class, you know, summer at General Motors. General Motors? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: No, it's some outfit, I don't understand what it is. He's going to kind of… see he's been in nothing but school all of his life. And he was a, a instructor in <Puerto Rico>, the University of Puerto Rico. And then they had some changes there in politics. So he was kind of let out. And then he decided… 





BILL CARSON: Excuse me, I'll be back in just a little bit. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: He wanted to know more about computers. See, he already had a doctor's degree in physics. And then he's going through this computer business. He's going to work to get the… how they do it in business, you know. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh uh huh. That’ll be good. Um, now your daughter, Mary. I'm sorry, I didn't get her name. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Marian Lee Carson. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, Marian Lee? And, ah, now what's her married name? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Sarraga. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, how do you spell that? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: S a r r a g a. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. And ah, oh where did she go to school then? You raised her out on the place, didn't you? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Yeah, but she came in on the bus. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: There was a bus then that would pick her up. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Well they had a little country school out there at first. But she wasn't born when they closed that down. So she went and caught the bus. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: She had to come all the way into town, though. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: I hadn't intend to send her to school until she was… well she was born in September, and I was going to wait. She was five when he had that accident. So I was going to keep her. But when he had that accident I thought well, it's better she be with some… you know, instead of worrying about it. So she went on to school. And then I went to a lumber camp and did a little teaching. It was all Greek to me, of course, but I could still read a little bit. (both laugh). 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: So you did teach? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: I taught… well from, well I think it was February until May, ah June, or somewhere through there. Because the teacher out there had quit. So I went out. It was a bunch of kids. They'd keep on leaving all the time. But they were nice enough kids, you know. 





BILL CARSON: (enters) Once I got it all broke up, I never did get it back together again. This arm was broken; it wouldn't set. And that leg was broken and left like that. It wouldn't set. 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Now I don't really like to send a kid to school, you know, on a bus. Because, you know they get so early in the morning, they aren't… I think it affects their health. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: What time did she have to leave? 



 



FRIEDA CARSON: Well, it was before eight. But ah, you know, it affects a kid, you know. They're nervous enough with out having to catch a bus. So I had intended to wait another year for her 'til she got older. 



 



TAPE ENDS 



 



CARSON INFORMATION WANTED 



 



At the family reunion in 1963 we read the second of a paper on the Brazos County Carsons. In 1962 we had practically no information concerning the Carson family but in 1963 we were a little better informed. Suggestion was made that these two papers be duplicated and mailed to members of the family with the request that they give us all the information possible concerning the Brazos County Carsons with the idea in view that this may help us in perfecting a genealogy of the family from Jack Carson, the emigrant ancestor to Brazos County, through the Fourth Generation if possible. 



 



We want birth dates, death dates, marriage dates and to whom married wherever possible. For instance: John Wesley Carson, his children, their birth and death dates, and to whom married and marriage dates. Their children, birth dates, death dates and marriage dates. We want as much of this as possible and any other information that may be of advantage to us. Send the information to R.R. Royall, 1820 Heights Blvd. <Houston Texas> or to Curtis R. Carson, 627 Bizerte St. <Houston Texas>. 



 



THE CARSONS OF <Texas> 



 



Albert Carson told me over the phone that John Thomas Carson came from <Ireland> during the 18th century settling in <Mobile Alabama> first. Then to <Texas> in the early 19th century finally settling in Brazos County Texas during the 40’s. His son was Nathan Franklin Carson the father of Curtis, Tom, Alfred, Nathan and girls. This was the information he had. 



 



From L. W. Kemp’s book “The Signers of the <Texas> Declaration” is the statement that “John Carson left his native <Ireland> to escape from being an Episcopal Rector and arrived in America in 1769.” Married Rachel first. When she dies he married Mary Moffett Mcdowell. Children from the first marriage were: Jason, Joseph M., Charles, John, James, Rebecca, and Sallie. Children from the second marriage were: Samuel P., William, George, Logan, and Matilda. This was in <North Carolina>. 



 



In a circular letter addressed to N.A. Carson, 2400 Peabody St., <Dallas Texas> in 1936 mention is made of a family by the name of Carson that was living in <Kentucky> early in the 18th century. From this line was found a Captain John Carson who married Mary mcDowell and had issue of: Samuel P. Carson and William Carson. It is also believed that a Thomas Carson born in Campbell County Virginia in 1760 and who died in Butler County Kentucky was of this family. He married Anne Porter and had a son by the name of Thomas. 



 



Christopher Carson, known as Kit was born in <Kentucky> in 1809 and died in <Colorado> in 1868. It may be that both Kit Carson and Samuel P. Carson both came from the same Carson family, and that the Brazos County Carsons either came from <Kentucky> or <North Carolina>. The <North Carolina> and <Kentucky> Carsons evidently were of the same family. 



 



J. R. Carson and N. F. Carson signed the Amnesty Oath of Allegiance in 1865 in Brazos County. N. F. Carson was Nathaniel Franklin Carson, evidently the father of the Curtis, Tom, Nathan, Alfred and the girls. 



 



Kit Carson was a trapper, soldier, hunter, guide, Indian agent, and finally a brigadier general in the U.S. Army. Went with Fremont on many of his famous explorations and many books have contained his exploits. 



 



Samuel P. Carson was a Representative in Congress from <North Carolina> and led a very romantic life. He was born January 22, 1798 the son of John Carson above noted. On one occasion fought a duel with a Doctor Vance over an insult to his father. He killed Vance just over the state line because dueling was against the law in <North Carolina>. Was elected a delegate to the <Washington> Convention from Pecan Point and vicinity, which was really in <Arkansas> Territory but they did not know it at the time. Arrived at <Washington> on March 10th 1836 and signed the declaration on that day. He was very prominent in the convention and was nominated for the President of <Texas> as was David Burnet. Carson received 23 votes and Burnet received 29 votes. He was then elected Secretary of State. His health was bad so Burnet replaced him temporarily with Baily Hardeman as acting Secretary of State. Carson died in <Hot Springs Arkansas> November 2, 1838. He had one daughter and one adopted daughter. 



 



I believe research could connect Nathan Franklin Carson with the <North Carolina> or <Kentucky> Carsons. Carsons are one of America’s oldest families. Appear to be Irish and Scots.

STATEMENT OF WILLIAM LEE CARSON, FLAGSTAFF, ARIZONA





MAY 1, 1963 



 



His father was John Wesley Carson born in or near <Bryan Texas>, July 19, 1863 and died in <Prescott Arizona>, March 31, 1961 in his 98th year of age. He writes the story as told to him by his father. The only full name used by his father, was this Grandfather’s name which was John Wesley Carson also. 



 



“I remember hearing my father talk over the years that the <Ireland> Carsons were from a kind of Baronage or Nobility, and that George Washington gave them some Negroes in appreciation for favors they did for him and the Army during the Revolution. They, the Carson’s, and Negroes seemed to have cleared land for people on down the Country from <New York> to <Virginia> and to <Alabama> where they settled for some time. Seems as though my grandfather, James Carson, owned some of the land that the Texas A and M College is on at <College Station Texas>.” 



 



THE CARSON STORY AS TOLD BY WILLIAM LEE CARSON 



 



“Jack and Mary Carson, both born Carson’s but no blood kin (my father’s great grand parents), came over from <Ireland> about 12 years before the Revolution, settling in <New York>. They had three sons, John Wesley Carson, Jack Carson and Mack Carson. George Washington, their first cousin, made their home and estate his headquarters when he would be campaigning in their vicinity during the war. The boys were too young for the army. After the war they moved to <Virginia>, and on down to <Alabama>. John Wesley traded property in <Mobile Alabama> for land in <Texas> near <Bryan> in Brazos County. He and family, or some of them, moved to <Texas> the year after <Texas> entered the Union, by way of Old Indianola, taking their Negroes with them, and settling near <Bryan> in Brazos County.” 



“John Wesley Carson and Jack Carson were twin brothers. They married Mary and Molly Henderson, and Mack married a younger sister. (Mary and Molly Henderson were also twins). John Wesley Carson’s sons were Franklin, William, Thomas, James, (my grandfather). Franklin’s sons were Albert, Turk, Tom, and Frank. John Wesley Carson was over 100 years old when he dies and presumably buried in the old Carson Cemetery in or near <Bryan Texas>. James Carson’s sons were Thomas, William, and John Wesley, my father. His daughters were Betty, Hatty or Hattie, Emma, and Nannie. John Wesley Carson was born in or near <Bryan Texas>, July 19, 1863 and dies in <Prescott Arizona>, March 31, 1961 and buried there in the Odd Fellows Cemetery. The James Carson’s moved to Leon County and settled between <Jewett> and <Centerville>. My father didn’t tell me anything about his uncles, perhaps some of them stayed in <Alabama>, or went somewhere else.”

This will was signed November 1st, 1864 by JOHN Carson, and probated March 16th, 1865. Petitioners state he departed this life on March 11, 1865. Record Book E., page 402 and Minute Book C page 214.

On July 5, 1963, Curtis Carson and R. R. Royall reviewed the will made November 1, 1864. Obviously John Carson was a wealthy pioneer but the residue of his estate was practically worthless for it was in Confederate money and slaves. He valued his homestead at $412.00 and ordered that all furniture, plantation tools, wagons, stock, horses, cattle and hogs be sold at public or private sale without order of any Court and the proceeds divided equally among his children.
