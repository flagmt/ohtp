KRISTINE PRENNACE: This is an interview with Mrs. Eleanor Durkee, who was born in <Flagstaff> in 1920. She is the youngest member of the original Prochnow family. The interview is conducted on September 11, 1976 in Mrs. Durkee's home, located at 406 E. Cherry Avenue in <Flagstaff>, by Kristine Prennace, representing the Flagstaff City-Coconino County Public Library. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay Mrs. Durkee, when and where were you born? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: In <Flagstaff>. October 11(?), 1920. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. And who were your parents? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Charles J. Prochnow. P r o c h n o w. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, and what was your mother's maiden name? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Ah, Burrus. B u r r u s. Elizabeth. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh! Okay, so her family was here for an awfully long time, also. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Ah were (?) brothers. The brothers. They were brothers. Four brothers of hers were here. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now did they work in the mill, then? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Yes, they did, uh huh. But they all came from <France>. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, originally. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Yes. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, and did they come right over to <Flagstaff>? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Yes. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Why did they pick <Flagstaff>? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: I really don't, I think because of the lumber industry. And they got started in the lumber business. And then mother came over about 1896, probably or '97. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: A good deal of background noise on the tape.) And she came over to keep house for them. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh. So then she met your father here. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Yes, right. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, what was he doing? Working in the mill, also? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Yes. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did he always work in the mill, or did he have another occupation? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: He owned the Commercial Hotel. He worked in the lumber mill for awhile, and then he owned the Commercial Hotel. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Had this… go ahead… 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: This information ______ (tape distorted) ________ sisters and brothers have already given you. Ah, I don't know the exact time. About 19, I'll just take a rough guess, maybe 1924. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Hmmm. Okay, it was after you were born. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Yes. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: So there had been previous owners of the Commercial Hotel. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: I believe one other. I believe it had been burned down at one time, and then rebuilt. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh. It's been in the family, or was in the family for a long time, then. Okay, let me go ahead and ask you, I know you had a lot of brothers and sisters. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Right. There were twelve of us in the family. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Six boys and six girls. Nice, even dozen. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah. Okay, besides Robert and Mary and yourself, what were the other names? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Raymond was the oldest. And he's now living in <Sun City>. Mary Lewis was the next to the oldest. I'm giving you as they go down the line. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: That's fine. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: And Mary was Clerk of the Court here for twenty years, I believe. Twenty some odd years. Mary Lewis, that is, yeah. Then we had a brother in Winslow who passed away in 1946. He was with the Texaco Company. His name was Ernest. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Buster… nickname, which he was known mostly by in those day. And then there was Cecilia. She's "Waterhouse", now, and she lives in <Washington DC> Then the next four were boys. Charles, Jr., he's living in <Downey California>; Robert, he lives in Montezuma, <Lake Montezuma>; then Richard, lives in <Downey California>; and George lives here. Next, four girls (both laugh). Martha's living in <Camp Verde>, Martha Butler. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Any relation now to the Butler Avenue people, or that the family? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: I don't know if that street was named after the family or not. They did live on Butler Avenue, the parents. And the parents were active in the lumber business, too. So I don't know if Butler Avenue was named after the family or not. Very well could have been. Katherine (sp.) and she's living in <Sun City>. Kieling is the last name, pardon me. K I E L I N G. And Betty Biller, and she's now living in Montezuma, <Lake Montezuma>. Recently moved down the first of September. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: And you were the baby, then? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: I'm the baby. (Both laugh.) I don't like being referred to as the baby. I like to be called the youngest of the family. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: The youngest, yeah. Sorry. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: But they still refer to me: “this is our baby sister.” 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: That must be hard as such a large family. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: It is, it is. They do it fondly, though, when they mention it. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, ah now where did you receive most of your schooling, then? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: All of us were educated here in <Flagstaff>. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. And what were… the Emerson or…? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: No. It was called St. Anthony. It's now Nativity. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: And, of course, Flagstaff High School. And I did go a year and a half at the college. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: The Training… oh, after. What was that, Arizona State College? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Arizona State Teacher's College. Then it was Arizona State College, then N A U. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. Do you remember any of your classmates at St Anthony's very well? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Yes, um, there's quite a few of them still around. Therese Fronske, Katie Kramer Best. Therese Fronske used to be Therese Jakle. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh! 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: She's one of the older… one of the older families in town. And Katie Kramer Best. And Marjorie Sherman Fleming's her last name, now. She's living in <Phoenix>. Let me see. And, of course, Frank Michelbach. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: And, Victor Nackard, and ah… 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Now is Marjorie Fleming, is that the Fleming family that's related to, was related to… 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: McMillan. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: McMillan's? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Yes. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Boy! A lot of old time families. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Right. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, this Jakle family, I did have a question to ask about that. Is there, are there some living in <Phoenix>, now? In <Sun City> or…? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Yes. Carter Jakle, Therese's brother. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Therese lives here, of course, you know she's Bob Fronske, the photographer's wife. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: See, I didn't know that she's… 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Bob is right. You may want to interview her. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, 'cause that's a good, that's an old family. I don't think we have any representatives of it. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: I believe she's the only one here in <Flagstaff>, still. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Is there a G.W.? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Jakle? That's Carter. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: That's Carter. Okay, good. 'Cause I looked him up today and and could only find G.W. Okay, did you remember anyone else particularly that you wanted to mention, or…? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: I'm sure there are more, but I can't think right now. Oh sure! The Babbitts. All the Babbitt girls. Mary Eleanor Bilby, Imogene Bader, and… we were all in school at the same time. Not necessarily classmates, but, ah… Betty Jo D'Mura. The Babbitt girls, the Joe Babbitt girls. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Okay. Ah, now it was all Sisters that taught at the school. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Correct. And they were the Sisters of Loretto at that time. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now where was your family residence? I didn't ask that. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Ah, we lived right near Southwest Lumber Mills. The home is still standing. My dad built the home. That house on the corner of Butler and Elden that has sort of a steeple up on the top of it. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: I'll have to go by and look at it. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: There has just been two owners in the house since we first sold it, and it's been kept up fairly nice, you know what I mean, for being in that older part of town. I'm happy to see it looking still nice. And the people that live in there have kept it up. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Were you some of the few white families who were on…? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: On the south side of town? Well, no, at one time, the Dolans, and the Cadys, and the Burns, all people who were connected with the lumbermill lived right within that block where we lived. And then, of course, there were a lot of the Spanish families and a lot of Mexican families over there. But then, then the town started that way then, it came this way. In fact a block from our house was, where there are now apartments, ah, was the first Catholic Church in town. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Ah! 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: And it has since been torn down. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: I see. So it really was part of the town's settlement. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Uh huh, uh huh. It started that way, and then it jumped (?) the other side of the tracks. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: We had many, many good friends among the Spanish and Mexican people on that side of town. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: The ones that I've interviewed have always spoken fondly of Prochnows, so, I guess they like you as much. Okay, why don't I go ahead and ask you then about your marriage and family. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: My husband and I were married in January of 1945. His name was Frank Durkee. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, when did he come to <Flagstaff>? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: He came to <Flagstaff> during the war years when they had the V-12 training program at the college. And he was in the Ship's Company. He was originally from <Oklahoma City>. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, I see. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: And, I was working at the college at the time. That's where we became acquainted. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh. In the administration or…? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Ah business office. My husband passed away March last year, of '74, '75. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh. That’s fairly recent. What did he do? What was his occupation? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: He was working at Navajo Army Depot. He had been in the paint business, also. For many years, he was working in the paint business, paint contracting business before he went to work at <Bellemont>. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. And you have children? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Three boys. We had three boys. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: And what are their names? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Ah, David, and he's living in <Colorado>, <Vail Colorado> at the present time. Comes home quite often, though. And, then our middle son was Patrick, and he passed away in November 1970. And then Michael. He'll be sixteen in December. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, so you've still got one at home. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Uh huh. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. Now do you remember much about the down town area? Well maybe we… I can ask you more about the south side, because you spent probably a little more time over. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Well, the south side hasn't changed so much. There's still a lot of the same homes over there. When we'd walk to town, we'd go zigzag, every other block, and turn from our house. It was zigzag or else we'd come up the railroad track. And we'd always tell our children when they'd want a ride to town, we'd say, "We always walked." Over there to the high school, home for lunch back again so forth. And, ah, San Francisco Street's always been about the same, with the older buildings that are on the street now. And mostly run by the Spanish people. And, let's see I do remember there was a laundry over there, June's laundry, ah, on the corner just before you would cross the railroad tracks. And so that's about all. It hasn't… well it's… a lot of the homes are still the same. A lot of the same people still live over there. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Now, the stores you mentioned, now they're owned by a lot of Spanish and Mexican people. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Uh huh. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Ah, were they at that time, also? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Yes. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Predominately. Uh huh. Were there many Anglos that had businesses over there? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: No, I don't believe so. No, they were mostly… the grocery stores were run by the Spanish people. And there were eating places, Mexican food places, and, ah. the bars along the street down there. El Rancho Grande and a few like that. (Both laugh). 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, let me see. Well, now, did your family do most of their shopping and things like that, north of the tracks, then? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Oh, yes. Uh huh. We always came north of the town, the tracks, which would be Babbitts' and Food Town. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, Food Town! 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Everybody used to shop there. And then, well Food Town, I don't believe was built until about, taking a rough guess, now, I think about in the thirties. But, before that, it was mostly Babbitts' Thriftway. And Babbitts' Thriftway was downtown now where, oh let's see, well in their building. But the meat department would be about where the men's department is now. The grocery store would be about where the shoe department is now. If you can imagine. And then the ready to wear on the corner where it still is. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh. That’s amazing. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: All under one roof, you know. It's like a big general store. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Ah, well let me see. You talked about a lot of the people in town, do you remember any of the, oh, special personalities of the town, like the Babbitts' would probably come to mind first, but, oh maybe, do you remember much about the Riordans or… 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: No, I don't. My older brothers and sisters would remember them much more than I would, because they used to be friends. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well there really wasn't anyone in that family that was your age, I see. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Right. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, let's see, was there anyone… were the Doyles still around when you were growing up? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Lee Doyle? 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Yes, uh huh. Now, I don't remember too much about him. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, ah, let me see. Now was the hospital built where it is now? Was Sechrist Hospital built when you were growing up or? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Yes. Uh huh. However, my boys were born in… at one time it was all Mercy Hospital, what we called "Mercy Hospital". Up by the… on Milton Road, up near Milton, that's called "Milton" up there. That's the… I believe where most of us were born. And then Sechrist Hospital was built before war years, I remember. Then, they did open up Mercy Hospital, again. And two of my boys were born… no one was born up there. And then the other two were born at the Sechrist Hospital. The middle one was born up at Mercy Hospital when it was re-opened, again, for awhile during the war years. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, I didn't know that it had re-opened. Ah, now was this always your home, or did… after you got married? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: <Flagstaff>. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well, after you married? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: I've lived here all my life. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. In this particular house, or…? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Oh, no. We've been here nine years. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: And where else did you live before? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Then we lived, when we were first married, we lived in some apartments that were on Birch Street. Then we lived in the apartments that are across from… it's now law offices, it used to be the Bledsoe house on Leroux Street. They were a big two-story apartment building that was owned by Dr. V.M. Slipher. And has since been torn down. And we lived there for a number of years. And then we lived into another house on up the street, 415 N. Leroux, which is next to the Paul Babbitts'. We lived there about five years. And then, we've since been here. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well, there wasn't much development. Did this area just open up when the Babbitts sold it, or was… were there always homes? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: You mean Pinecrest? 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Yes. It's just been developed since it was opened up by the Babbitt, who all was involved with __________. (Phone rings). 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, do you remember much about the social life of the community? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: No, not really. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Your mother didn't belong to any clubs? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: She was too busy raising twelve children. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Really, okay. (laughs). 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: She was a member of the Church Altar Society. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah that was a pretty busy organization. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Right. And ah, I don't know how much social life they had in those days, you know, really what sort of activities. Ah, whether they even had the country clubs then or not, I don't remember. I don't, believe. Ah, but of course, they were too busy raising their family. And Daddy was busy with the hotel. And I don't remember them going out a lot. They'd go to the show, maybe once a week they went to a show. That's about it. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: So, ah… 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Well, most of our activities are at home. We had lots of get togethers at home, card games, and people in all the time, and everything. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay; now we talked a little bit about the church. You can remember when it was over on the south side, or was it already back over here? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Ah, no, I can remember the building. The building was vacated at that time. They were using it, I think, for a couple of grades of school. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: And ah, no the church that I remember is the one, Nativity was now where the school is. And then I remember the church being built when I was in grade school. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: The present Nativity Church. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Let me see. Well we talked about the Altar Society a little bit so we can go on from there. Do you remember much about the politics in <Flagstaff>? Now your brother was fairly prominent. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: _________. And Mary was active in politics. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, she was also. Well she was Clerk of the Court. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Clerk of the Court. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: So, and she had to run for that position? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Right, right. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: So your family was fairly well involved. Did your father ever hold a public office? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: No. No, he never did. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Again, he was… 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Too busy, working. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Really. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: I'm sure he was active in whatever downtown activities was required, like Down Town Business; they didn't have a Down Town Business Men's Association at that time. But I know he supported anything to do with the downtown area. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, ah, let me see. You would remember, maybe, the Depression. Do you remember how that affected your family or <Flagstaff>? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Ah, slightly yes. I do remember. I don't remember how it affected <Flagstaff>. I don't believe it was felt too much here. I don't think we had bread lines and all that sort of thing. But it was just that things were leaner. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: But we always got along real fine. There was no real hardships. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well, your family was into the Commercial Hotel. I imagine, you know, business must have slacked off some. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Oh yes, it did. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. Now World War II, your husband, obviously, was ________. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Right. Several of my brothers were in service. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: And ah, so we did feel the effects of World War II. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. Now, were you working? You said you were working at the University, then. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Right. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: How did… besides the V-12 program, how was the University affected by? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Well, probably, the University would have had to possibly close if we hadn't received this school up here. And, what they did, they trained the boys to go into officers' school. This was preliminary training before they went in as officers navy and marine. And we had four hundred of them here at one time. And, of course, the enrollment at the college was very small, and then when war broke out, all the boys just, all of them just went into service. And so, it really cut down on the enrollment. So, possibly, had the V-12 Training Program not been settled here, I don't know what would have happened to the college. It probably would have had to close, because the enrollment probably would have been down to about a hundred and fifty. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Wow! That really… 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Because, at that time, oh when I was working up there, it seems to me like there was about four hundred--five hundred students. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Boy, it really… 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: They really, it really did make an impact on the town. Of course, that helped the town economy. And then, <Bellemont> starting up because of the war activity, brought a lot of people in. And that's what kept <Flagstaff> going during the war years. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. Now, let me see. Do you remember any fires in the area when you were growing, any major ones? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Well, there were several fires at the Southwest Lumber Mill. Of course, it was called "Saginaw and Manistee" Lumber Mill at that time. And I do remember them, because when we were little, and a fire would break out, of course, it would always be quite a big fire. And there were at least two big fires over there that were quite serious. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did it ever threaten your home? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: No, we were far enough away. Had it been maybe a real windy day or something like that, it could have. But we would be about… well where all the logs are backed up. They're backed up right to the back yard now, that was all big open field at that time. And the mill was quite a distance, oh, say a block away. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: So you were able to keep it pretty much contained, then. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Uh huh. Right, uh huh. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. And ah, what about any flooding. I've heard from some people it got pretty high on the south side. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Uh huh. I remember when we were seniors, in 1938. One day they did have to let school out so that people who lived over by the college could get home, because all that area, what we call "the five points" now, that was all water. And then the south… an awful lot of water on the south side where the banks of the Rio de Flag ran over, River de Flag ran over. And… but I never remember any down town flooding, you know, like on Front Street, Santa Fe, we call "Front Street", 66. It was mostly right in that low-lying area by the Guadalupe Church and near the banks of the River de Flag. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: And, then I believe they had other floods before that, but that's the one I remember. That was in '38, '37--'38. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. And what about dry years. Do you remember a few of those? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Uh huh. When I was young, I remember a very dry year, and we'd have to go up on the peaks and haul our water to get water from the springs up there. And then they did bring water into <Flagstaff> on the train. The train had to bring in water. And it was rationed pretty much. So, people really had to watch it. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah that must have been really difficult with a large family trying to ration it. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Well, we'd catch the rainwater and anything that was possible. Buckets and what not. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: That must have been hard. Now, what about the big snow years. Do you remember any particularly well? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Well, the one… was it 47 or 49 that we had such a terribly big one? And, then, of course the last one we had in '67. Those were the two biggest ones, uh huh. And, of course, it always seemed like big snowstorms when we were growing up, because we had to walk through the snow before the snowplow got out. They always seemed like they were heavy snows. And, we didn't have radios then to tell us that there was no school. We just had to go. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, yeah. So you just… they just went ahead and opened the schools, because they figured everyone would have to show up. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: So we'd just show up. It was awful. (Both laugh). 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, I can imagine. You must have been drenched by the time you got home. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: We were. Be frozen. But we'd often… from our house we'd stop off at the hotel. My daddy had it. And, ah, get warm; thaw out for about ten, fifteen minutes before we went the rest of the way to school. But many a morning, we'd get in there and be such… so cold. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now this sparked another question. Do you remember any, like famous people that stayed at the Commercial Hotel, where your father owned it? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: I don't remember them, but there were many, many movie stars when they would come to the area to make movies. Not long ago, there was an article in the paper about when the Commercial Hotel burned down, and, I believe then, it listed some of the movie stars. But, no. Some (?) the real old time movies stars. And Zane Grey used to stay there a lot, and ah, I can't recall right now, my older brothers and sisters would remember. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, right. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: The names wouldn't mean anything to you, I'm sure, other than having heard them through your lifetime. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. Now let me see. Well, do you remember any epidemics or anything, any illnesses the town was real concerned about? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: No. 



 



END TAPE 1, SIDE 1, BEGIN TAPE 1, SIDE 2 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: We came down with it. One of the younger ones brought it home. We were quarantined for six weeks, because just about the time one would get over it, another one would come down with it. That went on for about six weeks we were quarantined. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Could anyone come and go out of the house? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: No, no. There were the four girls and the youngest brother. We were all at home. We were quarantined with an older sister, Mrs. Waterholes, and Mother. And then the boys stayed down at the hotel with Papa. And they would bring groceries to our back door, and leave it; talk to us through the windows. And that was _______. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, my gosh. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: And, of course, at that time, Scarlet Fever was quite serious, because, which is hardly heard of nowadays. You very seldom ever even hear of a case of Scarlet Fever. It was quite serious then, because they didn't have the medicines. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Right, they didn't even have penicillin, did they? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: No, oh no. We were all quite sick with it. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, I imagine your family got just about every childhood illness. (laughs). 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: I'm sure. And, when one would bring it home, then it'd go down the line. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. Let's see, we talked about the Spanish and Mexican people over on the south side. What about when the black people came in? Now, you were very young… well, you were probably old enough to remember. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: No, I remember when we were growing up, there was just one or two black families in town. And ah, the Dorseys were one of them, I believe. The Dorseys were about the first black family in high school. And, I believe the first one to graduate from high school was in one of my sister's classes, Katherine's class. I believe that was the first black to graduate from Flagstaff High School. And then after that, there were few (?). I can't remember if there were any in my class or not. No, I don't believe there were any in my class. And then, I guess, you know the families were very few at that time. There was a colored porter that worked for my dad at the hotel. We just thought an awful lot of him. Fred, Fred Hoke (?). And ah, he worked for daddy for… well as long as I can remember at the hotel. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you know what the feeling was of a lot of the people in <Flagstaff> when, I believe it was Mr. Cady, brought in a lot of people from <Louisiana>? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Well, they were, I don't think there were so many colored people among them. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: I really wouldn't remember that. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, okay. Yeah, you would be awfully young. Okay. Ah, let me see, now you mentioned the June family. They just, now when you were growing up, did they have their laundry still on the south part of town? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Uh huh. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, so it was after that they moved. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Well, and then they had, then they had the restaurants. They had several restaurants, Chinese restaurants in town… they were called Wong Junes. They went by the name of "Wong". And then they have since, June. It's June now. I believe they were the ones that had the laundry. I'm sure they were. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Right. Okay. And were there any Indian families in town that you can remember? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: No, I don't believe so. None that I can remember, when we were growing up. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah. Do you recall about when some Indians started moving into town to live? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: I would say during the war years. Because so many were employed at <Bellemont>. And they set up the regular Indian village out at <Bellemont>. Had a regular Indian village where a lot of them lived. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh it was like traditionally style housing or…? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Yes. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Hogans? I didn't know that. Okay, and, now with your father being involved in the Commercial Hotel, I imagine you were aware of tourism. And, ah was there much before the war years that you can recall? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Just summer tourists. It would always be a busy time during the summer. You know you'd always have your usual people that were travelling back and forth to the coast, or going east. Of course, during the Depression, it was really no one passing through then. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Very lean years. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well there weren't many motels then. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: No. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Around. Did people prefer to stay in hotels, do you think? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Oh, I think so, uh huh. A lot more _______. I think they stayed at hotels. I can't remember the first motels; one or two motels scattered here or there. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: But ah… 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: You've seen a whole lot of changes then in that direction. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Oh, yeah. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. Ah, now, let me see. Were you or your husband ever involved like in the symphony or any of the music programs? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: No. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, I won't ask that. And, do you remember east <Flagstaff>, what it was like, when you were young? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Well we called the one area "Sunnyside". And there was no development, other than the homes out there, but no businesses. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, really. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: No, no businesses. There may have been a little corner grocery store, but, ah, I would say no businesses until the motels started in, and then, started in with the development, what is now east <Flagstaff>. And that would be during the war years. Sunnyside was when a lot of people started in building out there. It was low rental, low housing. And it wasn't zoned very much at that point. Which is a shame, because it such a beautiful area out there. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yes, it is. Okay, now let's see, we talked about the growth of the University. When did it start picking up again, as far as enrollment? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Oh, after the war years. And then it has just continually grown. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Okay. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: It had that continual growth. But when you used to see just the main building, Old Main and the Administration Building, and then the dormitories, Hanley Hall, Campbell Hall and Morton Hall that are right around where the Activity Center is… not the Activity Center. What's the main building, now? 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, the auditorium. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Yes, uh huh. The old auditorium. Now that was built since the war years, of course. And then, the way it has expanded, now. The little rock cottages that are in the center of the campus, now, they were way south of the campus. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, they're right in there. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Right in the middle of the campus. There were never any strict rules we had to follow. We just naturally respected our parents, and just never had any problems. You know, when they said, "do something", we did it. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: And ah, we all had our chores to do on Saturdays. Each one had to divide up. One had to dust; one had to sweep; one had to shake the rugs; one had to scrub the floors. And we just had our duties to do. And when our jobs were done, then we could go to <Oak Creek>, if we wanted to, with a group of the kids or whatever. We always had lots of kids always in and out of our home. All of our friends always remember coming in the back door and through the kitchen. And Mom always baking bread. All the good smells that used to come out of our kitchen. We had a very happy home life. We are still all very close. All of us. We get together every once in awhile. Get togethers. When everyone comes up from <Phoenix> or different parts, we all get together and have cookouts or visit. We had a family reunion three years ago down at Montezuma, and sixty-five of us were there. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh my gosh. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: That was children and grandchildren. And we… for three days, we had wonderful time. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah that must have… 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: We're still all just very close, very close. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: That's great. Oh, okay. You were talkin about going to <Oak Creek>, now was it the road that it is now, or was it a different one? 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: No, it was the same road. I can remember when it used to be a dirt road. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Hmm. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: And going around some of the corners, you'd have to back up to go around some of the corners, very narrow, very scary, very scary. That was when I was real young. But during the high school days, it was paved, but it was a narrow… narrower than it is now. And nothing like, you know, not nearly as nice kept up as it is now. But we'd always go down there in the summertime. And what used to be called "The Canyon". What's there now? I don't know if there's anything there, now. The Simpsons owned the cottages, and there's a swimming pool down there. And we'd always go down to the swimming pool. And, of course, it was beautiful, quiet, and not all the traffic and congestion that is down there now. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Was Lolomai Lodge still down there when you… 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Ah, I don’t, Lolomai was just kind of a ghost house, then. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: It was torn down; not torn down, but run down, and not inhabited at all. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Hmm. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: And, it, ah, was falling apart at that time. But Mayhew's Lodge, do you know where Mayhew's Lodge is now? That's the one that the Forest Service has recently taken over. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: You can see it… 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: And I believe boarded it up. That was a beautiful place, just simply gorgeous. It looked like the Shangri-La. And Betty Mayhew was in my class a good friend of mine. And, we'd go down there, visit with her quite a bit. It's a shame that they don't do something about restoring that place. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, I know it. If it's the one I'm thinking of, you see it off to the right as you're going down. It is beautiful. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: And, I believe the Forest Service is taking over that property within just the last six, eight years. And, they were going to make a visitors' center out of it. And, why they haven't, I don't know. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: But, when you were growing, you can remember people staying there just like a regular resort. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Oh yes, it was a lodge as a resort. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. It's amazing. 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: And, ah, there's a beautiful place there, at meals (?). Of course, it was a regular lodge. But it was a beautiful place. And, we'd often go down just for dinner. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh! 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: And, of course, Todd's Lodge, which is now run by the Garlands', I believe. It was another beautiful place to go to. I haven't been down there for several years, but I believe it's still kept up like the Todds used to run it. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Huh. I didn't know that. I've never been over on that… 





ELEANOR PROCHNOW DURKEE: Oh, you haven't. Oh, that's a beautiful place in there, too. Used to be, anyways. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay.
