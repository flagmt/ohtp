KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. Mr. Garcia, when and where were you born? 





G.R. GARCIA: I was born January 2, 1904, <Flagstaff Arizona>. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. And, who were your parents? 





G.R. GARCIA: Mr. and Mrs. Ambrosio Garcia. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Ambrosio? 





G.R. GARCIA: Uh huh. Garcia. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. What was your mother's maiden name? 





G.R. GARCIA: Ah, Lebrada (?) Barela. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Barela? 





G.R. GARCIA: Uh huh. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. And, where were they from originally? 





G.R. GARCIA: From New Mex… My father was originally from <New Mexico>, and my mother, I believe, she originally come from <Mexico>. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. And, ah, what brought your parents to <Flagstaff> to begin with? 





G.R. GARCIA: My mother came up. The way I understand it, I really don't know, is my father was from <New Mexico>, and he was here, naturally, and my mother and my older sister, that died here, they came from <Mexico>, and they came by way of <Texas> through <Ft. Davis Texas>. And, I think, I'm not positive, but I think, my sister was born in <Ft. Davis>, in <Texas>. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Did your father… what kind of work did he do? 





G.R. GARCIA: Well, he done most of, in his younger life, the way I have the story was, that he was a freighter for the Indians, up to the Indian reservations. And he was here for a number of years, I guess, before he met my mother. And, ah, the way I understand it, they met, I guess here in <Flagstaff>. My mother was cooking for the Santa Fe when they was building the railroad through. And she was cooking for the Santa Fe. And, I understand it, she went as far as Peach Springs with the Santa Fe. And they naturally… she came back, and, I guess, they got married afterward. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. So he worked as a freighter most of the time then. 





G.R. GARCIA: Yes, until his later years and then he went to work at the sawmill. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: For the Arizona Lumber and Timber? 





G.R. GARCIA: Arizona Lumber and Timber Company. It used to be over here by the Holiday Inn. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Ah, now where were your parents living when you were born? What area? 





G.R. GARCIA: On Grand Canyon Avenue. 66 Grand Canyon. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Is that over by, where the Yost family lived? 





G.R. GARCIA: Yeah, right across the street from them. I grew up with ________. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Okay. And, you mentioned one sister. Did you have any other brothers and sisters? 





G.R. GARCIA: No. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. And where did you have most of your schooling here? 





G.R. GARCIA: I had it here in <Flagstaff>. I didn't go very high in school. I only went about the fifth grade. And, I was a type of a fellow… I started out in the Catholic school, and I ended up going to Emerson. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was that St. Anthony? 





G.R. GARCIA: Yeah, it used to be St. Anthony. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Okay. Now, when you quit school, did you go to work immediately? 





G.R. GARCIA: I worked here for awhile. And, in 1926, I went into the service. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh. Okay. Okay. You worked at the Arizona Lumber and Timber? 





G.R. GARCIA: Uh huh. I worked there for awhile. And, I also worked at the old Cady Lumber Company. That's over there. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. What kind of work did you do for those? 





G.R. GARCIA: Laborer. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Okay. And, what branch of the service did you go into? 





G.R. GARCIA: I went into the infantry army. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: And, did you stay there until retirement? 





G.R. GARCIA: I stayed there about, a little over twenty years, I guess. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh. Did you ever work at the Ordnance Depot? 





G.R. GARCIA: Yes, I did. I worked there for a very short while. I guess for about four or five months. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh. Was that like during the war years that you worked there, or…? 





G.R. GARCIA: No, I was over seas during the war. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Okay. Let me see now. Did you ever marry? 





G.R. GARCIA: Yes. I was married and divorced. I was married in '35 and divorced in '37. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Ah, she wasn't from <Flagstaff>? 





G.R. GARCIA: No. She was from <Texas>. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh. Okay. Ah, now let me see. Well, growing up in <Flagstaff>, then. Do you remember much about the downtown area, what it was like? 





G.R. GARCIA: Oh, yeah, I remember the downtown area. When I was growing up there was… I remember even when they started the pavements here. That was years and years ago. The downtown area, when I was growing up, was mainly from the Bank Hotel down to what is Santa… not Santa, San Francisco there. And used to be nothing but ah Chinese restaurants and saloons at the time. And, there was three saloons that I remember, very well. One of them was Pfeiffer’s (?), and the other one was Sandy Donohue and Black's Bar, which is the old "66" now. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Do you remember much about Sandy Donohue, or…? 





G.R. GARCIA: No. I just used to go in there through the back way to sell some empty whiskey bottles I used to pick up after the dances. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, it was just like returning coke bottles or something. You'd get… 





G.R. GARCIA: Just about the same. Yes. Used to go there and get five cents a piece. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh. (laughs). Oh, I didn't know that. So that was kind of, as a kid, that was your income? 





G.R. GARCIA: Oh, yeah. Sure. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you have any other little jobs that you did as a child? 





G.R. GARCIA: No, I did not. Mostly played hooky. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: (laughs). Now let me see, were, were many of the people over in your neighborhood Mexican-American? 





G.R. GARCIA: Most of them went from where, well, the time that I remember, there was the Yosts there on that, on that street there. And, then from there on down, there used to be one, two, there used to be four Anglos there. There was the Yosts, and, I don't remember the names of the other ones. And then, later on, the Wyatts moved right across the street from us. But most of them was Mexican-Americans. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. 





G.R. GARCIA: Up there. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did most of them work in the mills or…? 





G.R. GARCIA: Well, some of them was working in the mills. Some of them was sheepherders. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, and that was their "in town" residence. 





G.R. GARCIA: Yes. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. 





G.R. GARCIA: They lived up there. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was there a pretty strong sense of community among the Mexican-American people? 





G.R. GARCIA: Well, when I was growing up, and I think there's still a quite a, not a heck of a lot, now, but, there was a little discrimination at the time that I was growing up. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. 





G.R. GARCIA: Especially among the younger kids. There was quite a bit of it. Of course, I didn't have that trouble, because I grew up with the Yost family and Michelbach family. And, they were my playmates, and the Conrads, and all them. I didn't have too much of a trouble. But, still, there was quite a bit of discrimination. And, up 'til, I guess, 'til after World War II, it was quite… not too bad ________. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Ah, well, did you have pretty much your own social life, then, among… 





G.R. GARCIA: Oh yes, yes. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: You played with the other kids? 





G.R. GARCIA: Yes. In the, the younger days, why, it's been like it is not, not, now, because they mix a little more now. But at that time, we had our own dances, our own social gatherings among the Mexican-Americans and Mexican people. And they had their own, which it is right now to this day, everything's been on this side of the track. It was at that time, all the Mexican-American people that… we had our dance halls on this side of the track, not on that side. But, it's changed a lot. It's got to where we mix now. Well, the younger generation does, but it wasn't that way before. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: You just had all your own entertainment. Did you celebrate, like Mexican holidays, or? 





G.R. GARCIA: Oh yes. They, even… when I was getting into my teens, they celebrated very much here the Sixteenth of September. And they discontinued that, I don't know since when, but ah, they have discontinued. See, I just come back here the last four or five years. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Hmm. 





G.R. GARCIA: I've been living in <Minnesota> for about twenty years. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh. Yeah. 





G.R. GARCIA: Yeah. But, when I was growing up, I mean that's before, before prohibition, why the south of the track, now you take, on San Francisco, what is there that I remember, what is there? Nackards' property is over there. You know where Nackards' are? 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. 





G.R. GARCIA: All them brick buildings there. There used to be about five buildings there. And that, well, that was the "off limits", because that used to be there a red light district there. And, then people’s (?) the ones that built them houses there. Nackard brought them property. And there where Otero's grocery store is there on the corner, right there, there used to be a saloon there, too. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh. 





G.R. GARCIA: At one time. In later years, why(?) Wong, a Chinese family then, they, they run a laundry there. But, everything was dirt here 'til they started the paving. I was pretty grown up, I guess about maybe fourteen, fifteen years old. But, everything was sidewalks; boardwalks, you know, all the way downtown. And then over here, where the underpass is, that was a steep hill going up over like that dirt road. And then coming from what is Santa Fe now; it was all a boardwalk clear on up to the Arizona Lumber and Timber Company and up to the Normal School. 'Cause that was the Normal school to start with. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. 





G.R. GARCIA: They only had, that I remember, let's see they had, Taylor Hall, Campbell Hall, and then they built this other hall, this side. And then they build Mother Hanley's dining room, which I don't know what it is now. There were only a few buildings there, four or five. And, Old Main, of course, was the one that was standing there. And, then later on, years, ah the other man that took over the college, his name was McFarland, then they built that auditorium on this side. That used to be the auditorium, there, connecting with Old Main. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh! 





G.R. GARCIA: Yeah that used to be the auditorium at that time. They used, when I was growing up, they used to have men and girls' basketball teams. I remember I used to go over there and see them play basketball. Then later years, they built the Training School. Well, of course, all the other buildings. But I remember Mother Hanley real well, because I went to school with, with one of her boys, George Hanley. And ah, I remember one of the matrons that used to be in Campbell Hall. Her name was Beckwith. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh. Uh huh. 





G.R. GARCIA: And she had two daughters that I remember. And ah, we used to go over… a small kid, used to go see the football games the Normal School play over there. They used to play where the, where the stadium is now, the football stadium. That used to be fair grounds there. Used to be a big fairgrounds there, and used to be fenced in. And ah, the Fourth of July celebrations was held there. And they used to… every year they used to have a free bar-be-que for the whole town. That was years and years ago when I was a young kid. And we used to go over there to see them play in the mud and the dirt. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember much about Old Town and what it…? 





G.R. GARCIA: Well, I remember Old Town very well, because I lived there all my life 'til I grew up. Well, over here where Coconino is, where it runs into the springs, well there was, ah, quite a few houses there. And ah, but up here, from the spring up here was only about one, two, three, four, there was only about six houses up there at the time. And ah, there were people that had settled here from <New Mexico> and moved up. And ah, the spring, at one time, when I was a young boy, why it had a roof over it. And ah, all the people around there, ran over there, and there was a bucket there and you just dip your bucket in the spring, fill your bucket and take it home… water. And even people from down town, down below used to come up in buggies and get water there. You know, that's all I can remember from oh, say from when I was eight years old up, you know. But beyond that, I don't remember very much except what I was told. And, across this track, across the track from the spring here, there wasn't any houses at all up here. There was ah, one, two, three, four houses here, but they were made out of ties. And they belonged to the Arizona Lumber and Timber Company. And some of the workers lived here. There was four houses here. And I think there was maybe two families to one of these houses. They were made out of ties. And ah, they used to be right across here. There used to be a spring, too, that used to come from under the tracks, there. Small track, and there used to be a feller that used to live there. And he went and piped it into the house. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Had his own spring water. 





G.R. GARCIA: Oh yes. But over here, up this way, there wasn't any houses at all, with the exception of one house that was there. And there was an old lady that used to be there. I believe her name was "Bryan or O'Brien"(?), and she used to collect bottles and old rags and things like that and sell them. I remember that we kids used to be afraid of her. And then, all this, just, you know not a thing in it. Of course, in later years, up in the early twenties, they built the armory there. And then there was, by that time, there were quite a few houses all around there. But, most of the people at that time was working at the sawmill. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: What, do you… just from… well you worked there a few years. What were the conditions like, working at the sawmill? 





G.R. GARCIA: Why, at the time that I worked there, at one time, they were paying twenty-five cents an hour. But, at the time in the years back, you know, that, I remember going to the store, and usually with a dollar you could buy plenty to eat, but you can't now. And ah, Babbitts' has always been the main store here. Yeah, at one time they had hardware, they had the clothing, and they had the fruit department, the meat department, and the grocery department all in one building, there. The original building that is there. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did Brooks, wasn't there a "Brooks" that had…? 





G.R. GARCIA: Oh yeah, he come in later years. He built a store right down there on Santa Fe Avenue and, ah, where you make the turn to go up Coconino, you know. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh. 





G.R. GARCIA: Yeah, he had it right there in that corner. And, it burned down. Yeah, he had a pretty nice store, Brooks. Uh huh. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was that mostly groceries or…? 





G.R. GARCIA: Groceries, and he carried, I believe he had some hardware, too. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Huh. 





G.R. GARCIA: Yeah that was on the corner, there. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Is that where your family mostly shopped after…? 





G.R. GARCIA: No, they shopped at Babbitts'. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: They always shopped… 





G.R. GARCIA: Yeah, because, at that time, Babbitts' used to have a man that would go out every morning to the different houses that had credit at Babbitts' and get the orders, and take them back. And they'd fill them at the store, and, then, sometime in the afternoon, they'd deliver the groceries to the house. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Ah. 





G.R. GARCIA: Yes. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, let me see. Now, your family was Catholic, then? 





G.R. GARCIA: Yes. We've always been Catholic, yes. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Did you go to the church that was over…? 





G.R. GARCIA: I went to the… I got confirmed and baptized in the old… where the old Brannen School used to be. It's an apartment house, now. That's where I went. There was some pictures in the paper the other day about that, a picture of that church. I don't know whether you saw it or not. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: I think I must have, but… Well, do you remember when it moved up this way, and when Guadalupe was…? 





G.R. GARCIA: I don't remember much about Guadalupe. I think I was already gone when they built Guadalupe. But, the, when they built St. Anthony, I went to school there. And there's a big house there on the corner, right across from the playground that they have now. You see a long house. I think they sell that all kinds of medicines, or I don't know what they sell there. Organic foods, do you know where that is, right there on the corner? 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh. 





G.R. GARCIA: Well that used to be a schoolhouse. That's the first school I went to. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: You actually went in that building. 





G.R. GARCIA: Uh huh. It used to be sitting this way, facing what is now the Church of the Nativity. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, it was facing that way. 





G.R. GARCIA: Uh huh. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, was it a one-room schoolhouse? 





G.R. GARCIA: If I remember correctly, I think it was. I think they had that… they had the other part already started, but that school, if I remember correctly was for youngsters, like kindergarten. And, I remember the teachers that I had was a… they weren't sisters of the school, but they were students, I guess at that time, or I don't know what you would call them at that time. But, one of them was a… the name was Elizabeth Hennessy. She and Virginia Feeling (?) used to be my teachers there in that little school there when I first started. But, I, I really don't remember when I moved into the school over there. I don't remember. But, I do remember my teachers over there. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did your parents have any kind of, oh, responsibilities that they had to perform for the church? 





G.R. GARCIA: Well, no, they just attended church. And, naturally, they done their donations to the church, whatever it was. That's about all. As far as being involved in the church activities, they weren't. They just attended church. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay um, ah, now we talked a little bit about prohibition. Do you remember much about it? 





G.R. GARCIA: I don't, I don't remember so much about it. But, I remember when I was a kid when they were… when they closed the saloons, they, they took a lot of whiskey barrels and beer out of Black's Bar. And they took 'em up for the Court House; it was up on the hill, there. And they broke them up and let them drain down the street. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: (laughs). And, World War I, do you remember much about that? 





G.R. GARCIA: No. I was, well that World War was in 'seventeen, of course, I was pretty good size. I just remember that all the boys going overseas, and when they were coming back. I remember mostly when the boys that I knew returned. Like a neighbor, we had a… up above there. And I remember when John Yost, that was the oldest son of the Yosts died. He was in the service, and he died out… he died, I think, during the flu epidemic. But I don't know where he was stationed, I don't remember. But, I do remember him. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, you talked about the flu epidemic. Did your family suffer from that at all? 





G.R. GARCIA: Well, the way I understand it, no. I never did catch it. And none in my family that I can remember died from the flu epidemic. But there was a lot of people here that did die. There was two or three families that lived on Grand Canyon Avenue that… they died from that flu epidemic. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any other kind of epidemics that were going around when you were in school? 





G.R. GARCIA: No. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, you were in the service during the Depression, but I see your family was still here. 





G.R. GARCIA: Yes. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: How were they affected by the Depression as far as you know? 





G.R. GARCIA: Well, I guess, that just like it affected everybody else that was working; had their ups and downs. And, of course they… it was pretty hard, I guess. I wasn't here; I was in the service. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Right. 





G.R. GARCIA: All the time of the Depression. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did it have any effect on people in the military, then? 





G.R. GARCIA: Well, while I was in the service, I never noticed much, only during the Hoover Administration, why, the pay was reduced from what… I don't know, so much percentage. But, then later on, it was given back to us after the administration of Roosevelt. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: And, now, you said you were over seas during World War II, what part? 





G.R. GARCIA: I was in the Pacific. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh. Do you remember any big fires in town when you were growing up? 





G.R. GARCIA: Not that I know of. No, I don't remember. I do remember one big snowstorm here, though. That was when Mrs. Costigan built the Orpheum Theater. I don't know how long it'd been built, but we had that big snow here that the roof caved in. And, also, that building right across from the Bank Hotel. It had a flat roof on it, and the building, the roof caved in. That was years ago. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was that the Aubineau's building you mean, across…? 





G.R. GARCIA: Uh huh. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: That one. 





G.R. GARCIA: Where Rowan's, where that drug store used to be there on the corner. I think it's a religious bookstore, now. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh. 





G.R. GARCIA: From there on up there. Up to the alley, you know, the alley run this way. And before the… City Hall used to be right across the street there where that parking lot is now. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Let me see. What about flooding? Were you ever aware of any, well at least high water? 





G.R. GARCIA: No, the only thing we have here is that River de Flag, which is dry half of the year. Well, most of the time, it's dry. But at one time, it used to; did carry a little bit of water. I don't know, I guess, it flooded down below us. I never heard of anything about that. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, what about some of the other ethnic groups? You were primarily Mexican in your background. And, there was a Spanish community, also, wasn't there? People from <Spain>? 





G.R. GARCIA: Oh, yeah, but, that… this, this is only not too long ago. I think, you taking… well from 1915 on up. I don't know where they disappeared, but at one time, there was a big Spanish community here. And, most of them were involved in sheep raising and sheep herding. And, then they were involved in businesses here, too. Like the Mohlers (?) and _________ and all… 



 



END TAPE 1, SIDE 1, BEGIN TAPE 1, SIDE 2 





G.R. GARCIA: There, and eventually, they bought their own bands of sheep and progressed. But, most of them were from <Spain>, and well, this was in the early, must be early twenties, I guess. ________ _______. Most of them lived down there on O'Leary and up in there. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did they have much to do with the Mexican community? 





G.R. GARCIA: Oh yes. They did, because most of their… like, one party that owned a pool hall down town. And well most of his business all Mexican-American business, and Mexican business. Yes. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Socially, did you intermingle a lot? 





G.R. GARCIA: Very little. Very little. Some of them went to our dances, but it was very little mingling. They mingled a lot among themselves, because, at that time, they had two hand ball courts. And they used to… they were real bettors. They used to bet a lot of money on their hand ball games. Yeah. One handball court used to be right down here on Clay. You know where that church is on Clay and Beaver, right there on the corner? 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. 





G.R. GARCIA: Well, the handball used to be just this way a little bit. And, then the Mohlers (?)… now the big hand ball court up there on the corner of O'Leary, where O'Leary turns south, they had a good big hand ball court there. And, there used to be quite a few families there. All in through here. But, they are all gone. Most of them have… most of, used to work for either the Babbitts or the Pollocks, or Hennessys, all them people that were stockmen here. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. 





G.R. GARCIA: And Pollock used to, well what is now, I don't know what they call that place where all them new buildings are from, from the high school on Ft. Valley Road, you know, all them houses on the left there. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. 





G.R. GARCIA: All that neighborhood in there, I don't know what they call it. But, at one time that used be Pollock's property there. And we used to have a racetrack there, for sulkies. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh. 





G.R. GARCIA: He had trotters up there, when I was a young kid. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: He raced them in other areas? 





G.R. GARCIA: Well, I guess he raced them in other areas, but he, he used to have a track there. I suppose they were for training, I really don't know. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. And what about black families. Were there many in town when you were growing up? 





G.R. GARCIA: Well, the families that I remember when I was growing up, one black family I remember very well was the Taylor family. And they lived right next to the River de Flag there on that street the other side of Emerson. I don't know what it is, whether it is Cherry or what it is. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh. Birch. 





G.R. GARCIA: And they lived in that corner. There was Joe and Lucy that I remember. They were much older than me, but that was one colored family that I remember. And, then, let me see. Oh, there was another family by the name of "Horne (?)". And he used to work at the Normal School. And they lived up here in Mill Town at one time. And let's see if I remember… I don’t remember his name. There was another feller here that I remember, his name was "Albert", and they lived right, right by where the Latin Quarter sits now. There used to be a house there. And him and his mother used to live there. That's when I was little. I don't know about later years. There's lots of them that moved in, but them's the old families that I remember very well. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: There just weren't very many, then. 





G.R. GARCIA: No. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did they stay mostly to themselves or did they…? 





G.R. GARCIA: Well, I couldn't very well answer that, because I was just a… small then, when I first knew them. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Right. 





G.R. GARCIA: And then there, there was another lady here that used to run a restaurant in the old Commercial Hotel. Her name was "Shepherd". And her… she used to run the dining room and the kitchen there. At one time, they had a beautiful dining room there. In later years, she moved down to the Weatherford. They had a restaurant in the basement of the Weatherford. And her name was "Shepherd". 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. And were there many Indian people in town? 





G.R. GARCIA: Oh, they used to be here all the time for the Fourth of July celebration, but not anything compared to what you see now. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: They didn't live in town then. 





G.R. GARCIA: Not very many that I remember. No. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember much about tourists coming to town? 





G.R. GARCIA: It's always been a tourist town. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did it seem like there were a lot when you were growing up? 





G.R. GARCIA: Oh yes. There… well, I remember in the summertime… what is that playground for the children over there, you know, at the end of Santa Fe Avenue there? Well they used to come up there and camp in tents and all that, and stay here all summer. People used to come and spend the summer here. And right there by Santa Fe, on this side of Santa Fe, where them houses are in that "V" that goes in there, that used to be a cemetery in there. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: That's where it was. 





G.R. GARCIA: Uh huh. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, I was never real sure. It was right there where… 





G.R. GARCIA: You know where that "V" is? 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. 





G.R. GARCIA: Where one street goes this way, and then Santa Fe goes up. Well in that "V" there, there used to be a cemetery (Ed: Mr. Garcia pronounces it "cementery"). 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Ah. Do you remember when it was moved, or…? 





G.R. GARCIA: Well, I was, I was young, but I don't remember what year or anything of that sort, no. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: You were school age, maybe. 





G.R. GARCIA: Yeah, I probably was going maybe in the second grade, third grade. But I remember when they moved that cemetery, there. And I believe that, if I'm not mistaken, that right across from Santa Fe, where I was telling you about this, I believe that they extended up into that. I believe I remember seeing some head stones there at one time. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: That went on up the hill? 





G.R. GARCIA: Well, it went up just so far up the hill. But it didn't go clear on up the hill. It started, oh, a little ways from the "V", and it went up, it was up to about second house, I guess. But, if I remember correctly, I don't know, I'm not too sure, maybe historians can tell you, but that cemetery, where I was telling you. Do you have a camp ground over there? You remember I told you? Well, I believe it; I even see some head stones over there, where that playground used to be. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh! 





G.R. GARCIA: I'm not sure, but I believe I did see some headstones, but I don't know how far they extended in that. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Huh. Okay. Now, what about East <Flagstaff>. Was there anything out there? 





G.R. GARCIA: Oh yeah. Well, when I was growing up, there used to be a little sawmill up there. They used to call it "Cliffs". 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh. 





G.R. GARCIA: Uh huh. And, there was some farmers all the way down there. But on this side, there used to be this sandstone quarry where most of these red buildings, the rock was taken from out of there for the college here. They built the college out of most of them rocks. Of course, in later years they didn't. And there used to be a dairy up there. His name was "Garing", I believe. But East <Flagstaff>, there wasn't anything up there. There was a man that owned a great big farm down there. His name was "Greenlaw". I believe Tommy Knoles married Eleanor Greenlaw. And they had a ranch up there. A great big one. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, I think that Joe Meehan, out at the museum, mentioned that you were in A Battery. 





G.R. GARCIA: Oh, yeah sure. You see this? This, when I went into the Guard here in the early twenties, it was a… it was originally there, it was a artillery outfit. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Where E-Z Mills is now? 





G.R. GARCIA: Yeah. That used to be the armory. It used to be an artillery outfit. And it was Battery A, because I went in there. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you know Ford McElroy, then? Was he…? 





G.R. GARCIA: No, I don't remember him. If I do… if I'd see him, probably I'd remember. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. He lives over in this area, too. 





G.R. GARCIA: Who? 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Ford McElroy or McEl roy? 





G.R. GARCIA: He lives up here? 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. I don't know if he was in the same time that you were. He would have been older than you would, I think. He mentioned something about having… Well, maybe it was later that he was in it, too. 'Cause he mentioned something about having to go down to <Florence> in, like 1930s. So you would have already been in the service. 





G.R. GARCIA: Oh, I was already in the service there, yeah. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah. So it must have been later that he joined. 





G.R. GARCIA: Yeah. I do remember that, that Battery A, at one time, had a semi-professional baseball here. A very good one, too. Ah, Shelby Lewis, that's… you heard of Mary Lewis Prochnow, that was the County Clerk here for years and years? Why, her husband, Shelby Lewis used to play baseball for that Battery A. And Brownie, he used to be the catcher. He used to play ball there. He used to work at the bank. And Swede Johnson, not Swede Johnson… what was his name? Oh, there was one Mexican boy playing. His name was "Amos". And he used to be the… he used to work for the Western Union. We used to go see him play. They used to play baseball where I was telling you the fairgrounds used to be. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Swede Johnson, do you know what his…? 





G.R. GARCIA: Oh, I know, this Swede Johnson. He used to go to school with me. He's about my own age. They used to live right across the tracks on San Francisco. His father was railroad foreman, section foreman on the Santa Fe. And they used to live right there. Used to be a big water tank right there. And their house used to be right in there. And then, the section house used to be right above them where the depot is now. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Just across the street. 





G.R. GARCIA: Across the railroad. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Hmm. Okay. Where the passenger depot is? 





G.R. GARCIA: Yeah, right across the street used to be the section house. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Hmm. Okay, can you think of anything else that would be interesting, also? 





G.R. GARCIA: No, I really don't. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: You've done a good job remembering. 





G.R. GARCIA: No, I don't know. I remember quite a few things. I remember the Fourth of July, when I was a young kid. We had a lot of fun at that time, to start off the day. Maybe you don't want to hear this. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: No, it's… 





G.R. GARCIA: It's, it's fun. I, I remember this. You know, at one time here in <Flagstaff>, they didn't have no fire department like they have now. They used to have a volunteer fire department. And over in Mill Town they had one fire department, volunteer fire department, and over in the main part of town, they had another volunteer fire department. And they had big hose reels, you know. And they kept them in little houses, you know. And they trained for fires and all that. And every Fourth of July, they used to go over there where the jailhouse is now on that street there, you know. Every Fourth of July, they'd compete against one and another. They had a team, you know. I don't remember the number of persons that pulled that hose reel. But they had a race from there to where J.C. Penney is now (ED: Birch St.). And they used to have hydrants there, you know, and where ever hooked first, well that was the winner, then. And then after that, they'd have some kind of a parade. And then we'd all go in the afternoon over to the fairgrounds for dinner. Because at that time, they used to have a free bar-be-que over there. And you'd go around there, and they'd feed you, and then you'd see… For the kids, they used to have a "grease fold"(?), a "grease monkey", a apple eating contest, and pie eating contest, a "three-legged race, sack races and all that. When I was a kid they used to do that, they used to have that for the kids. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: That's a big day. 





G.R. GARCIA: Yes. And, well, I was a teenager then. They used to have dances there on Santa Fe. They used to block off from 'Frisco over to the next block and have dances right in front of the Commercial Hotel. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, just in the street there? 





G.R. GARCIA: Uh huh. And then, where the sidewalk is on this side, they used to set up booths in there, you know. And they used to sell things there. This is not so long ago. This is in the twenties. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: That's neat. 





G.R. GARCIA: And where you people are, over there at the museum that used to be the County Hospital. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Ah! Do you remember much about the people that were there? 





G.R. GARCIA: I don't remember the people there. But we used to have a… one party used to live in a house, and they were putting in the sewers, at the time, and they were working back of the Barge (?) home in the alley, there, putting in, digging the ditches. And he got hit in the head with a pick. So he… his wife was living there on that property, and, I remember her going over there to visit him all the time. He was over there at that County Hospital. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. 





G.R. GARCIA: Right there by the old… where the old Penney is, where… what's that name… you got that grocery… not grocery, but furniture store there, above… on this end of the Kinlani? 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. 





G.R. GARCIA: That used to be Penney’s at one time. (ED: Corner of Birch and Leroux). But before they built there, there used to be a house in that place there. The owner was Keller, Mr. Keller. He used to run, where Chois' is now? He used to run a bakery and candy store there. And then, where Bledsoes, down below where Bledsoes is, there used to be another grocery store in there. The people that run it was, name was Crawford. They used to have a big grocery store in there. And over here where the training school is, the Flagstaff Laundry used to be there. Yeah. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you think, thinking of anything else? 





G.R. GARCIA: No, I think I've talked too much. 





KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, you've done fine.
