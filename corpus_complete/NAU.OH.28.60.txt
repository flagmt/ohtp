MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Well, I guess looking for a job or something, I guess, you know.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: He might have heard there was a job.

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Yeah. There was some friends of his here that had already came from the same town in <Spain>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you know what their names were?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: The lumberyard.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Which mill did he work?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: ALandT?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Yeah, uh huh.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Now, which one was this called? Do you remember? Was it owned by the Cadys' at that time?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: No. It owned by Dolan. Of course, (conversation is not picked up). And then, we had cows, and we used to deliver milk.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh.

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: And, you know, to made the living easier or better, or whatever. So, that's what he did. And, Mother had a boarding house, and there were quite a few Spaniards here at the time.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, where were these places located? Your… where you kept the cows, and where you had the boarding house?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Right where we lived. Right over there in Elden Avenue.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: In Elden.

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Uh huh. We had a big barn in the back. We didn't have too many big cows, about five or six.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. And the boarding house was right there in your home?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Yeah. It was a two stories. At first, it wasn't two story. Afterwards (?), it was… oh, we had about five or six, and then we had some sort of a little houses sits in the back rooms; cabins. And that's where the men sleep.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh. So they did that most of the time that they were here, then? How long did they keep the cows?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Well, I don't remember the year, but then, like the town started growing up, they didn't want any cows in town, so they…

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, it was before, like World War II.

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Yeah. Uh huh.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you have any brothers or sisters?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Yes. I have a brother, Tony Becerril. And, Joe Becerril and Frances Becerril.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Frances is your brother?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Sister.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: And, where did you have your schooling, then?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Well, like I said, I went to this Brannen School, here. And, then I went to the Normal School over… which is the college, now, but they had the grammar school in the bottom. You know the big building, the first building there by the training school now. That's what it was in the bottom. I think there was… I guess just until sixth grade. And, I went there.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Who were some of your teachers at the Brannen School?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: At the Brannen School, it was Mrs. Francis, but I don't remember her first name. And she was Raudebaugh after she got married.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh. Was she any relation, do you know, to John Francis or Peery Francis?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: I think they were, I think they were, but I'm not, for sure, I don't know.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. And, how many grades did they have at Brannen?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Well, I guess they had about fourth grade. And, then they closed it for a little while. So, then is when I went to the other school. It was closed for, you know, a year three years. And, then even my brothers went to school there, after they reopened.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you know why they closed it?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: No.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was it just, mainly, Mexican-American and Spanish American?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Well, it just was what the neighborhood was. It didn't make any difference, you know. But, of course, not too many Americans lived here at this time. Of course, at this house there were Americans living here.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh.

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: But, ah, everybody was mixed, you know.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: It was fairly well integrated?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were there some black families living here?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Not too many. No, no, I knew Anita Fuller (?) _____, and the other one, I don't know. But, there weren't really too many colored people here.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: No. Do you remember any of your schoolmates, particularly well?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Well… (laughs)

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Just any who happened to be friends.

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Uh huh. Well, the Molers, Alice Moler and Mary Moler. They were pioneers, too.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh.

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: And, Felice Crowder, Felice Crowder. And, the other ones, well, I knew lot of them, but I don't remember _______.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh. Is she married to Joe Montoya?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: No. She's a widow, right now.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. There, there were a lot of Spaniards over in this area, huh?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Yeah. At that time there were. Which there isn't now.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: No. I always assumed it was a Mexican population.

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: No. There were quite a bit of Spaniards in this area here. You know this was… well it was build then, more, but, of course, a lot of these houses here, but they weren't built then.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Mmm mmm.

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: But, they built them afterwards. And, ah, like the college was nothing, you know, just a, and, ah, we used to just walk, and keep going. We didn't have to go on sidewalks, there wasn't any. Some people had wooden ones, you know, lumber ones, but that was about it.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: That was about it. Were there any difficulties, like between the Mexican population and the Spanish population?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: No.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: None. Did you have any communication problems 'cause you spoke slightly different, or…?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Well, we could understand, we understand each other, naturally. But, ah, there's a little difference, and especial when I came at first, you know, it was hard. Because, there's a lot of… and I didn't talk like them, you know. But, of course, we understood each other, which we still do. But, there's another accent to it.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Makes it a little bit hard. In school, did you have to speak English?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: No. Uh uh.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: At the Brannen School, you got to speak Spanish?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Yes, of course, with all the kids, you know. I didn't know English, so I had to talk Spanish. (Laughs.)

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. But, did you have Anglo school teachers, or did you have Spanish or Mexican?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: No. They were Americans.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. And, did they just speak English to you?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Uh huh, uh huh.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh. That must have been very difficult.

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Yeah. At first. But, after a while, you know, you get to understand when you are a young kid, you pick up here and pick up there.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. So that must have been ______. Ah, what was your, what was your parents' expectations towards your education? How far did they want you to go, and where did they want you to do with it?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Well, at those times, times were bad, you know, so, I really didn't go to school. I just went to the sixth grade.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh.

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: And, ah, there were more children, and mother had more children, of course, so, _______ died, so there were just four who are living. And, ah, so, I had to help at home. So, some days I would go to school; other days I wouldn't go. So, finally, I… you know, you get to an age where everybody's ahead of you so you don't want to go anymore. So, therefore, I quit at sixth grade.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Mmm mmm. So, it was more important that you stay home and help, then.

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: I guess so. In those times. You know, they didn't, like now, you have to. But at that time, why…

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah. That's right. So, when did you get married?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: I got married in 1929.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: And, who did you marry?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Camilo Gonzalez, Camilo, Spaniard from over there, too.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, he was also…

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Yeah. From a different state, but <Spain>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, did you have your wedding at… is it Guadalupe Church? Is that what it's named?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: No. There was no Guadalupe at that time. No, ah, before I work at Penneys' for three years before I got married. And then, I worked at noon, and at, at those times, you know, they would shivaree you, what ever you call it, shivareeing? And, we didn't want that. So, I work until noon, and we got married, well, I guess we went to courthouse and to the church and all that. Just, like that, you know, not pay ______. And, ah, when we got out of church, there was lot of people out there waiting for us. They found out! (Both laugh.) So, we went and had it.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You didn't fool them.

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: No. I should say not. And, we were married at the Catholic Church. Not the one now; it was the other one. It's right where the school is, where the St. Anthony, or whatever school is.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Okay. Nativity. Was it called "Nativity" at that time?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: I think so. What does it call now. It's a different name from then on? I read it, and I read it in the paper the other day.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh.

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: There's where I got married. And then, in '29, they were building this church, which is over there at… what is it, on Cherry?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, okay. It's up in the north part of town.

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Uh huh. They were building that. But, still, they had this other church, at which is they, it was an auditorium after they built this one. And, then they tore all that down and built this school.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: So, now it was up on Cherry Street you were married? Up in that area.

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: There was no ______, Guadalupe Church then.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: No. I, for some reason, I thought that they moved the old Nativity Church down and that became Guadalupe, but no.

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: No.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. I was just confused on that. So, what did your husband do?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: He ah, he was working as a sheep, sheepherder.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh. Uh huh. Now, did he live in town then? Did he live in town with you?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Well, he lived out, out in the… at camp. And, after we got married, I went with him to the ranch for a little while. And then, start having the kids, so I couldn't stay out there. So, I stayed in town. And then, why, he kept working with the sheep. In 1949, he got his own. So then, I was… well I was working at Penney's again, after my boy start school. You know, his first grade school, I start working at Penney's. And, I work at Penney's until 1957.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Well, who did he work… who'd your husband for at first, then, if they weren't his own sheep?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Ah, Campbell-Francis.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: No. Oh, this is a different Francis. And, Campbell, what's his name?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Campbell-Francis.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. What was ranch life like then?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Oh, I couldn't really can tell much, because I wasn't there too long. Just ah, just, no, no, we didn't have no farm, you know just sheep around there, that's all.

And, where that five and ten from Babbitts', you know, where you park, that one, that was a garage, Babbitts' garage. (ED: Aspey, Watkins and Diesel Building). And, Babbitts' used to have their chickens right in the back, you know, in the cages, and they used to just get them from there and kill them and put them in the market. That was long time ago. Yeah.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Goodness. _______ I didn’t know that.

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Right. That's what I remember. You know, like a little kid, you would go through the alleys. (Laughs). And, I would see the rabbits and chickens there, and they would kill them in there to the market.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah. Or anything you remember really well.

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: Well, when I came the Molers were here. They lived in this, over here. And, that's about the only Spanish girls there were then. But, they were born here in the <United States> _____ I think ______.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh.

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: And, ah, Mary Prochnow used to… played with her, you know. They were there. And, and Poole, but _______ Helen Pooles, they used to live right next to school, so there were American people down here. And, there still are a few. And ah, yeah, now Helen… and the other sister, I don't remember her name. But, she's married to a "Wolf" here, and they're still here.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh.

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: And their mother, I saw her mother the other day in the store.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: That's the Pooles, now what did they do?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: They used to work for the mill. That's about all that was here, then.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well, did the Prochnows, the Prochnows start over at the mill, and then eventually move?

MARY ARSENIA GONZALES: I really don't remember that. I remember them having the Commercial Hotel.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, uh huh.
