KRISTINE PRENNACE: This is an interview with Helen Harnisch, who came to <Flagstaff> in 1920, and was in the first graduating class at Flagstaff High School. Her father, Walter Runke, represented northern <Arizona> in the state legislature and served as postmaster for <Flagstaff> for a number of years. The interview is being conducted on July 6, 1976 at Mrs. Harnisch's home at 116 E. Elm Avenue in <Flagstaff> by Kristine Prennace, representing the Flagstaff City/Coconino County Public Library.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Mrs. Harnisch, when and where were you born?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: I was born in <Panguitch Utah>, in… do you want my date?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, if you don't mind giving it.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: All right. On March 7, 1907, because I'm sixty-nine years old now.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, okay. And who were your parents?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: They were Mr. and Mrs. Walter Runke, Sr. And my father was in the Indian Service, and that's just one of the states I lived in while he was in the Indian Service all over the west. And we lived in <California> and <Utah> and <Colorado>, <South Dakota> before we came out to <Tuba City>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: So you actually lived on a reservation _______?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: On the reservation, Indian reservations.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh! How did the reservations compare?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Well ah, of course some of them I don't remember very well, because my youngest brother was born in <South Dakota>, and I don't remember about those Indians. But remember mostly about <Tuba City> where the Navajos and Hopis were. And very little the rest of the time, because I was pretty young when we went out there. And we had our own little grade school. Had to have a private teacher. And just had all eight grades in the one room.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Huh, I didn't know that.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: So it was a boarding school for Indian children. And it was very interesting. We learned a little Navajo to get along, you know.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah. Do you know what your father's duties were?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Yes. He was superintendent of Indian schools.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: And that's… it was always in connection with an Indian school in all these reservations and in the states. And that's where my mother and father met was, they were both in the Indian Service. My mother was from <Missouri> and my father was from <Wisconsin>, and they were appointed in the Indian Service, and met at Blue Canyon, which was the school at the time. And that isn't even existing any more. And then, they were in all these other places and wound up back in <Tuba City> from about 1914 to 1920.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was your mother's maiden name?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Ah, Mary Jeanette Morris. And, let's see, then we just stayed out there until we were all ready for high school. And that was in 1920, and we moved into <Flagstaff> so we wouldn't have to divide up the family and send us off to school. They didn't have any other schools then out there.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, so that was, that prompted your move then…

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Yes, to <Flagstaff>, uh huh. And then my father worked for Babbitts' in their office, Babbitts' Trading Company in the office. And then we've lived here ever since.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Then what other… let's see… was he like… and he worked in the office, okay.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Yes, uh huh.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What type of things did he do?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Well he was a bookkeeper.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: In the office, you know, that they had downtown, their big store. And then, I didn't know who you wanted me to tell you about, that afterwards or…

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Why don't we go on talking about what he did.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: All right. Then he later was the senator from <Arizona> for two terms down in <Phoenix>, state senator. And then he was postmaster for several years. And then he also was manager of Clark Homes when they were renting all those for several years.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now was that in the forties, _______ ______…

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Yes it was. It was even later, uh huh. The last thing he did was manage that. Then he retired… Clark Homes.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh. Do you remember when he was post master?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: No, I can't remember the dates on that, I'm sorry.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh that’s fine. No. So did you have any brothers, you did have brothers???

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Yes. I have two brothers. Walter Runke, Jr. and Sidney Morris Runke. And my brother Walter was on the school board. He worked up at the University as a… well he was manger of the grounds and buildings and grounds up at the college.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: But he did serve on the school board?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Yes, he was on the school board.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did the other brother Sidney live in <Flagstaff>?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Only a very short time, because he lived in… he is now the chief metallurgist for El Paso Gas Company. And before that, he lived in <Bolivia> for years. He worked for the government in the Bureau of Mines in <Washington DC>, and in <South Dakota>, and in <Missouri>, <Rolla Missouri>. And right now, he lives in <El Paso Texas>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. Now we talked a little bit about your schooling at <Tuba City>.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Then we came to <Flagstaff>, and I went to high school here. And was one of the first of thirteen to graduate in 1924 from Flagstaff High School. It was the new building. And then I went to the Northern Arizona University, and I have a BS in Education, and then about thirty hours toward my masters. And I taught twenty-five years in <Flagstaff> in the public schools, and retired in June 1972.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, recently.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Recently, uh huh.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: At the high school, do you remember any of your teachers very well?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Yes. Miss McNerny was a teacher, and let's see, I don't think any of them are living here any more. I can't remember any others.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Can't remember any ______ whether they live here.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Yes, uh huh. Well, there was a Mr. Sitler (?), and ah, he was the science teacher, and I hadn't thought of that in years.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, that's okay. I just thought maybe, _______ _______ would stick in your mind. Do you remember any of the students you went to school…?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Yes. I went… Tommy Knoles was in my class, and he's been a prominent person in politics and in <Flagstaff>, and family.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Ah, was one of the Switzer girls?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Oh yes, Agnes and… Agnes Switzer Anderson. And recently they had a picture of us in the paper, and we had sort of a reunion, and we were only three in town that I know of.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh uh huh. Well out of thirteen. (Laughs).

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: That's right. Not very many.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: No. Like school supplies and things like that, were the students pretty much have to provide their own?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: No. The public schools have always provided theirs', and all of those things. And it's just been wonderful, they've just been great about anything that was necessary or important for their work, you could always get it, get them. And it really was a wonderful school system. I enjoyed doing that very, very much.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Where did you teach?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Ah, first in Emerson School. That was three years before I was married. And in those days, if you got married, you couldn't teach school, which is certainly different nowadays. And then several years later, I substituted at almost every school and every grade for about ten years. Then I decided to just go back and renew my certificate and teach steady, have a steady job. So after that, I taught then in… they had… Marshall School was part of the high school, and then they built, Thomas School it was, then they built Marshall School, and I was there when it was finished, new. And I taught first grade then. And I enjoyed that very much, first grade.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: When you were teaching at Emerson, who was the principal there?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Bertha Kennedy. Ah, Mrs. Kennedy whom many old timers remember. Bertha Kennedy was the principal. And then, of course, she moved away during those years I didn't teach. But, Lura Kinsey was the principal, my first principal. She certainly was a well-known person.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: I believe she spent most of her life here.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Yes she did, <Flagstaff>, and in school.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Remember when you were first teaching, what the public opinion towards education was? How'd the parents feel about their children going to school?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Oh, I think everyone seemed to be very enthusiastic and wanted them to have the best they could were interested in cooperating. I thought the parents had very good attitudes.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you teach anyone that has played kind of an important part in <Flagstaff> now?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: No. But there are lots of… lots of people around that still live here that I run into, and they're grown and married. In fact before I quit, I had some of their children and some of their relatives, you know. They'd say, "Oh my uncle went to school to you", or something like that. And I often meet them now.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: So a lot of them are still around in the town.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Still around, uh huh.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Ah, okay. Do you remember any special activities that the high school had when you were going to school there? Anything that sticks in your mind, oh celebrations perhaps, for some reason or another, or sports? Did you participate in any sports?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: I didn't, but there certainly were. And my brothers did, in football and… There were… they had their teams, but maybe not as many or as big a variety now of sports that they might have. But they had football and basketball, mainly.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, you got… you married here in town.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Yes, I did. I married in 1929, and we bought this house on Elm Street. And I've lived here ever since. I married Edmund John Harnisch. And he was from <St. Louis Missouri>. And he lived here until his death on November 8, 1963. He was manager of the Safeway stores for fifteen years; he was a CPA at the Navajo Ordnance Depot during the war, and then he worked up at the college on the grounds; in the buildings and grounds for the last few years. Quite a few, I guess. _______ remember. Some ten or fifteen years up there. And his father was a retired physician from <St. Louis Missouri>. That's how they came out here. And he also was a brother-in-law of Dr. Fronske, Martin, 1883-, Dr. G. Fronske. Dr. Fronske's wife, Hilda was his sister, so they were here, and his parents came here, and that's how he happened to come out west. And he thought it was simply marvelous not to live in all of that air pollution and big city with all the wide-open spaces we had out here.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, that was in the 1920s that you were complaining about the…

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Yes, uh huh. Yes, even then. (Both laugh). That was just the ideal place, he thought.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you have any children?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: No. I don't have any children. But my brother, Walter had three children whom I've just been around and feel like they’re my own ever since they were born. And also my brother, Morris, has two, and they've always lived away from here so I'm not as close, but I am as close as I can be with the distance. But my brother Walter's children are very special to me. And they are Gayle Runke, and she is Mrs. Charles Siroky, now, and lives in <Phoenix>, and her husband is a dentist. And she has four children, and of course, I adore all of my grand nieces and nephews. And then the other, the next boy my brother Walter had, was Robert Runke, and he taught school here for a short time, but he lives in <Phoenix>, too. And he has two sons. He works for the Honeywell Company; he is a computer programmer, and with his two little boys. And then I have the other nephew is a doctor, Lawrence Runke, who is now a surgeon in <Cottonwood> in the Cottonwood hospital. And he started there just this spring. And so I am very close and very fond of them.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. Why don't we talk about the downtown area of <Flagstaff>, you've always lived pretty… probably pretty close to the downtown area.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Pretty close to it.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What changes have you seen?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Well, there were houses all the way down in the city, these great big houses that are all gone now, and it's all business. And I remember especially when we first came; there was a little wooden church down here on San Francisco. And that was the Presbyterian Church or the Protestant Church. And it was moved to way on South Beaver, I believe, and became a Mexican Church later; the Mexican people did. But I've always belonged to the Federated Church, and that was the only protestant church for awhile, so all denominations could belong there, and it's especially Methodist and Presbyterian. And I'm a Presbyterian, and so there were only that and one Catholic Church when we first came here.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Now there's just any number of churches. And of course, the big homes that were down in town, and where the library was, was such a fantastic big house, the Babbitt home, and across the street from it, was the big brick houses.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Where APS is now?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Uh huh. Uh huh. So there are many changes down in town. The residential part has moved out a lot.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Several blocks back.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Yes.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Remember any theaters down?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Yes, there was just one. The Orpheum and that was the only one. It's been there since I've been here so…

KRISTINE PRENNACE: In its present state?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Right in its same place, although I think they've enlarged the inside.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh uh huh. Did it have a flat floor when you first came or…?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: I don't remember about that. But that was part of what we did for recreation was go to the matinees and to the movies, weekends especially.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What other kinds of things did you do for recreation?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: And then, of course picnics and going to the scenic places around here was one of the most entertaining; the most fun, you know, like <Grand Canyon>, Grand Falls, <Oak Creek>, and that type of thing.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. You used to drive your car out to like Grand Falls on those roads? (Laughs).

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Yes. Yes, on dirt roads, and there wasn't any paving on the roads down to <Oak Creek>, either. And they were rather dangerous and, especially in stormy weather, you couldn't get through. And, it was kind of exciting going around all those curves, one way. (Both laugh).

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Was it pretty much the same road as it is now?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: No, it's been changed some. You can see from the new road some of the cliff on the sides where it used to go with very sharp turns. So, it was a wonderful feat of engineering to see how they put it down in there so beautifully now.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah. Did you ever go out to <Walnut Canyon>?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Oh yes. <Walnut Canyon> and walk around the ruins there, and <Wupatki> and all the other parks around. It was just a wonderful vacation time to do things like that.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What hospitals were in town in 1920?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: The only one was the one way up where the old mill is now, the Arizona Timber and Lumber Company in that big home beyond where the Dolans lived. And it wasn't very big, but that's the only hospital we had until Dr. Sechrist built the original one up here where it is now. Of course, it's enlarged a great deal since then.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Right. Was it just that original rock building in front?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Yes, yes in front.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh boy, it was tiny.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Oh, yes.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was there a library in town?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Yes there was. But, it wasn't very big, and it was in the Women's Club Building.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: It was just a little part of the Women's Club.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Yes, part of the Women's Club Building at the time.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Let me see. Oh, who were some of your neighbors? Where did your family live in <Flagstaff>?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Oh, we lived on North San Francisco Street, ah 711 N. San Francisco Street. And that was just the edge of town. There wasn't anything beyond that. And my dad bought that on purpose, because we'd been living on the reservation for so many years. And he said my brothers needed a place for space so they could even throw a rock without hitting anything. We were used to living out on the reservation, you know, so that was a wonderful place for us.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: But there weren't very many people around?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: No. That was the end, the last house on that street, and there was nothing beyond that when we first came.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Huh. Did Columbus go by at all?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Ah that’s the one on this side? I think that it was just opened, but it wasn't always paved. And of course, the streets didn't go on out over the hill either on San Francisco.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh no.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: It was in the woods.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was Switzer Canyon like?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Oh that was a wonderful place to go hiking to. There was nothing over there just ponds and fun for skating in the winter and playing, you know. That's where so many of the people would go, you know, children especially for a Saturday hike.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Were there any roads that went through?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: No, no roads.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Nothing but just a big canyon.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: A nice big canyon a wonderful place to go and play.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Sounds like it. Well do you remember anything about the social life of the community? It’s such a hard question.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Well, I think most of it centered around church, you know, and the groups and the dinners and the things that the church would do. And then of course, there were clubs. I think the Shakespeare Club was one of the oldest clubs in the state. And I belong to it now. And we have some wonderful records in the library of the college about it, which are interesting to read. And, so that is one of the first ones I know that they had, or that type of club. And then, of course, there are always card clubs and groups that, you know, got together. Our family, for instance, we'd go on picnics and go fishing at Lake Mary. That was the fun thing to do on weekends.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were there any roads out to Lake Mary?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Just dirt roads. And they were passable and okay, you know. We had a Model-A and managed to get out there. And you could really catch fish in those days.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh really? Now was it as large as it is now?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: No, not as large. Because, upper Lake Mary was put in later. It was just the lower lake.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Mmm. Now, was that shallow or…?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Well, not so shallow in those days. There was more water out there than there were years later. And then they dammed it, and made the upper Lake Mary so that it would be bigger.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Did you ever go out to Lake Mormon?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: And to <Mormon Lake>, too. And it used to be full and big. It was bigger than Lake Mary. And, 'course I think it's practically disappeared now, hasn't it?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, at times of the year.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: And that was another nice place to go fishing. And of course, we did horse back riding, too.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: They used to bring them up from <Phoenix> every summer, and that was one of the things I enjoyed doing.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, did you rent them or…?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Yes. You could go and rent a horse and ride for two hours or all day. And so there were a group of us that did that. I did that even after I was married, because I love horses. When we lived on the reservation, we had our own ponies and horses, because there were lots of sand dunes to ride to and places to go and have fun, springs and all. And that was part of what we did for fun.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, we started talking about the Federated Church. Do you remember who the minister was when you came?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Let's see. When I came, I think there was a Reverend Dando(?), then, of course the Reverend Johnson (?), and Reverend Hessel(?), and they alternated between Methodist ministers and Presbyterian ministers. And so there's been any number of them. And since, you know, and I can't remember the order in which they all came.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was it a large church _______?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Fairly good size, because it was all the Protestants that ah, organizations… I mean there were no other churches, so any Protestant could belong. It was mainly started by Presbyterian and Methodist. But, they had the Christian Church and several others.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: We can talk a little bit about World War II's effect on <Flagstaff>. You mentioned that your husband… was that your husband?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Oh yes. He worked out at the Ordnance, and he was a CPA or in the office out there while the Ordnance was running in those years. And…

KRISTINE PRENNACE: He still continued to live in town?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Yes, because they commuted. That's about twelve miles out. So they would just drive out, you know, and he used to be on different shifts like they had, and they'd have to take turns. And I particularly didn't like the graveyard shift when he'd have to go at night and drive out. But, it was very tight security, you know. Only people could get in that worked there unless you had business. But it was an interesting thing, and it certainly made our town bigger at the time, because many people were employed out there; local and many were sent in, you know.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were you teaching school then?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: No, I didn't teach, I didn't go back steady until about 1942. I just did substitute teaching and then I went back in 1950.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: And didn't stop until I retired.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: I was just wondering if that constant fluctuation with the Depot had any effect on the schools.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Yes. That and also, the gas pipeline had a lot of effect on the school, when they built the El Paso Gas Pipe Line through here. We had many, many children come while they were within this area. Then they would move on to the next, you know, as the pipeline was going. There were many of those. Also, while the Ordnance was out there, and it went on for many years, I had many Indian children, because there was an Indian camp out there, too.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: And so they were bussed in, of course.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was that difficult? Did many of them speak English?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Well, most of them did. The most that we got did. And I think they had sort of a nursery school or a beginner's school out there to teach them enough English to begin. Because they were very interesting students artistic. I enjoyed them very much. So I got acquainted with many of the families and had several members of their family while they were out there.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, that's when a lot of the Indian families moved into town?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Yes, it is.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were there any at all in here?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Oh yes always a few who lived here. But mostly lived out on the reservation. K: Do you remember any of the ones that lived in town, the few ___?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Oh my, there were some, too, that were connected with the museum, you know, worked out there for many years, too.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh, right.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: I can't tell you off hand any names.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, okay. Oh, while we are talking about ethnic groups, were there a lot of Mexican-American students?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Yes, always, quite a few of those.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: I don't know, I've just become aware of the difference between the Spanish-Americans and the Mexican-Americans. Was that distinction ever brought out among the people that you know?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: No, not particularly. There were some that were Basques and Spaniards, but not too much was made of that, you know. There were fewer of those than there were of the Mexican-Americans.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. And were there very many black families when you came here?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Not too many until the mill, the Southwest… I don't know whether that's the name, there were two mills, but the mill over… that's running now. When they first started that one, they brought many, many colored people here. And many of them have stayed here.

 

END TAPE 1, SIDE 1, BEGIN TAPE 1, SIDE 2

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were there very many oriental families?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Not very many. There were just a very few. Some that had restaurants here. And there are more now.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh!

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Yes, a lot more now than there were. We only had one, I think, one Chinese restaurant. And so there were some nice families that came here with one, and then there were two. They were the first ones that I remember.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Oh, we can kind of go back to the Depression and how it affected you in <Flagstaff>.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: As much as I remember about the depression, they'd often remark that it really didn't hurt us nearly so much as it did many other parts of the country, because our town wasn't very big, and not too many people lost their jobs. And, <Flagstaff> seemed to be fortunate not to have just too much suffering from the Depression. So we were always happy that we were here and not in some place that was really hard up, you know.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: It didn't affect your husband's job?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: No, it didn't, because he was manager of the Safeway stores at the time, and they had to have groceries so that was lucky.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Now we can talk… do you remember any fires particularly well in <Flagstaff>?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Not very much, except when they'd have a fire at the mill, which was pretty bad. And, I do faintly remember some big fire at one of the lumber mills. And it was, you know, it was a pretty destructive. But I, I think it was so long ago, I don’t remember too much about it. And then, of course, forest fires were always a big danger, but none ever affected really close to town. But, we were always very conscious of forest fires.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Would men in the town have to go out and fight them, kind of volunteer?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Yes, uh huh. Yes. Sort of volunteer. They used to have a group that they could call volunteers. And I know my brothers used to go once in awhile, and when they needed the extra men. And so, we were sort of more conscious of it, you know, when you had to help put it out.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Right. What about any flooding?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Not that I remember anything serious. Sometimes River de Flag would get a little bit high, and it would be down in the low part of town. It might come up to the door step, but it never was anything tragic as far as I can remember to wash out anything; homes or stores or anything.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any dry years, any droughts?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: 'Course that's always been one thing, I think about <Flagstaff>, never seemed to have enough water. That's our big problem. And it always was. 'Cause I can remember in the day when we had no water and even had to close school when we didn't have water. And, you'd have to go and bring your own water from the springs around town. Or one year, they hauled in water on railroad trains in big tanks. And so that was always a big worry. Were we going to have enough water? And or course, it's wonderful how they've developed all the wells and the lakes and the things now so that we can have at least all our… I didn't suppose <Flagstaff> would ever grow, because we didn't have enough water. There was nowhere to get it. Now apparently, they drill for it and are trying, so we don't run out.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Right. When they hauled the water in on the train, how did you get the water?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: You used to have to go down with your big tank or big cans and what ever you could bring. And then they did… when they haul it with the train, they tried to pump it into the system. But if it were possible, that's what they did, too.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: But for drinking water, you'd have to go to the springs. And there was the one over in Old Town Springs, the one they are trying to make a park out of now. And then, there was one out beyond the Museum.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: So you could, at least, go not too far away for it.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh my, but still you'd have to go out and get it.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: That's quite a bit to get your own water. (Both laugh). So we've always been very conservative with water.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any of the big snows?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Yes, I remember about three of them. And especially the last one, which was what… eighty-four inches or sixty-four inches. Something terrible. It almost snowed us all in, and could have been much worse if the power lines had gone out. But, it was right at Christmas time, and everybody was trying to go somewhere. And, it was just a miracle to get out of here at the time.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: And then while I was going to college, too, we lived way up here on the north side of town, and you'd have to walk, and you couldn't even see over the piles in the center of the road; not even a car on the other side. And very few cars were out. So, you walked back and forth to the college.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, but school continued to go.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: At the college it did, but they had to stop, cancel, the public schools, you know.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did the businesses stay open or anything?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Any of those that could, yes. And of course, the first day or so you couldn't get around, but as soon as the plows could make a path, why then things went on as normal as they could in such deep, deep snow.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were there any big epidemic type things?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: None that I remember, because… well let's see, see I was living in <Tuba City> when the big flu epidemic was on. I just barely remember that my father had it and was very ill, but recovered. And there were many people who were sick out there, but not nearly so much out on the reservation as would be in town, close in the city. But… and then of course, there was one year when the spinal meningitis, they closed school, because some of the… several cases, there were several cases, and some of the Riordan family. And so, they were, of course in that day, there wasn't a great deal they knew to do about it. So for a short while, that was pretty much feared you know, and so they did close schools for awhile. I don't remember how long.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. What… have you seen tourism really pick up…?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Oh my yes. I think that that's one of our big things. I think it always has been, but now we are more accessible with highways and more advertising; people, the Chamber of Commerce and all working toward that. And so, I think it's grown tremendously. And of course, that's one of our big assets, our <Flagstaff> scenery.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember the train used to run to <Grand Canyon>?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Yes, uh huh. In fact I went on it one year, and it was very rough. It was a rough ride up there. I don't know whether the tracks were… you just couldn't hardly stand up. I belong to the Business and Professional Women's Club, and we had a convention up there, and that was when Governor Hunt was the governor, and he was to appear there. And we dressed all as cowboys and cowgirls and hats and all, and our club went up on the train. And so it was quite a memorable time.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: I bet. Do you remember much interaction between <Phoenix> and <Flagstaff>?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Not a great deal. In fact we always thought we were ignored a little bit up here, you know. And of course, we weren't as big a city as they. But I think relations have been much better. Our communications, our roads, and our highways make us closer now than we used to be. And we've grown a great deal.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: But you were pretty much isolated from other parts of the state.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Yes uh huh. It was just one of the larger places in the north, and of course, now it is the largest, I’m sure.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Since you went to the university… what years were you there?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: I was there from, let's see, in twenty-six, twenty-four to twenty-six, and then I went back summers, and then I finally got my degree in 1950. So I went in forty-nine and fifty. and then, many times since in summer classes and workshops. But, it was certainly very small at the time in comparison to what it is now.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. You could teach school without a degree?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Yes. I had… all you needed were two years of college at the time, in twenty-six. Then I taught just three years, and of course, you had to renew that. But then, I went back, and you had to have your degree. So I just needed to finish that. And when I did, why then I taught from 1950 on.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any of your instructors in 1924, ‘26 that just stick in your mind.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Well, there was Dean Minnie Lintz, you may have heard about her. She was a very, very interesting and very prominent teacher up there, and a Miss Lora Maxwell and, of course, they've retired many years ago and don't live here any more. And Miss Mary Boyer and summer times, we'd have visiting professors. And, Dr. Robert Powers, who is well known from a way back. And, that's about all I can think of right at the moment.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were the classes very small, class size?

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: Well fairly, although some were rather large. I would say up to forty in them, you know, but as a rule, certainly was more individual than it is now. And, you knew everybody, almost, everybody on campus, and all the teachers. And the same way with downtown, you knew everybody. For years when you walked down the street, you could speak to almost anybody. Nowadays, it's very rare if you see one or two that you really know.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh.

HELEN RUNKE HARNISCH: In public places.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Right.
