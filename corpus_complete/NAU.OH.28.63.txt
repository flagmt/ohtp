KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. What kind of childhood; do you stay here through out your childhood then?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh yes. Yes, I was here permanently up until, well, you might say '23.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: 1923.

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh, I'd go away, and then come back, but as a rule, I was here. But after that why I've been over in <California>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh. Well when you went away and came back, what were you doing? Did you get married and move away?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh, my folks lived here. My mother, they lived here; she died in '39. I came back here and taken her back to <California>. And then my father was killed over in <California> in '46, '47.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: So you went to school here.

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh yes. I graduated out of the public school and out of the Northern Arizona Normal.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. That was like Emerson School…?

MRS. ANNA HART: That was the Emerson, yes.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh ______.

MRS. ANNA HART: Yeah. And this was the Northern Arizona Normal. Now I understand they've changed the name.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: It's the University now, uh huh.

MRS. ANNA HART: Dr. Blome was the president of the college. He had a wonderful school. I don't know what it is now.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Can you remember any of your schoolmates, any one in particular?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh, well they're all gone. Edna Heckathorne was one. Electa Otteson, I see she's still here. I haven't run on to her. And, Bessie Kidd, oh there's quite a… Flora Dory (?). They're all gone now. And then there was Mary Greenlaw. They were twins, Mary and Louise Greenlaw. Oh there's a lot of schoolteachers. Garing (?) Hazel Garing (?); Ruby Garing (?).

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What kind of activities did you have at home at that time? Daily, kind of chores, or…?

MRS. ANNA HART: Well we were raised different what the children are now days. We were home after school; we stayed 'til four o'clock. We come home; we had our chores to do. My mother worked and my father worked.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What did they do?

MRS. ANNA HART: My mother was a nurse. My father was a stone mason. That's how they cut all that stone.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: So do you remember any particular holidays or celebrations in the town that every one pretty much joined in on?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh well, they always celebrated the Fourth of July.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was that celebration like?

MRS. ANNA HART: Well they always had a parade, the Indians would come in. We (?) really enjoyed it. And then on Sundays, I was raised a Seventh Day Adventist, and we went on picnics. We went fishing, and we went down on <Oak Creek> fishing, camping.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: How did you get down to <Oak Creek> then?

MRS. ANNA HART: Horse and buggy, wagon, spring wagon. In those days (?) no cars.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: About how long did it take to get down there?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh, maybe five or six hours.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Really! It took that long. Did you camp out?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh yeah. They used to… the <Schnebly Hill>… that's years ago, that was seven and a half miles long. Well then they, I think they closed that. There was only two places on there you could pass a car. And then they built the other; fixed the other road. And I think it's only two and a half miles long. I'm not sure about that. But it wasn't as steep as the <Schnebly Hill>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: That was pretty steep then.

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh, definitely.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now is that the one you went down?

MRS. ANNA HART: If you’d go over that rim, boy, you'd never know.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah.

MRS. ANNA HART: Been a lot of them that went over the edge of this _____. (Background noise).

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. That's interesting. Did you go to any of the others like <Walnut Canyon>, did you used to, camping?

MRS. ANNA HART: Yes, I’ve been to there. <Walnut Canyon>, yeah. My folks owned a ranch down near there.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh.

MRS. ANNA HART: Then I've never been to <Tuba City>. My folks have been there. I never was there. Been to the <Grand Canyon>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, how long did that trip used to take to the <Grand Canyon>?

MRS. ANNA HART: Well, I, I don't know. It was quite a, quite a trip. Take you all day, and start out real early in the morning. We went around, in back of Elden Mountain, around through the edge of the <Painted Desert>. At that time you didn't go up around through <Williams> and up. I think they've got a road cut now through.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. So you had to go all the way around?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh yes.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was it all farm country out there? Were there ranches then or…?

MRS. ANNA HART: Not behind the mountain, there wasn't.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: There wasn't any.

MRS. ANNA HART: There's Schultz Pass and all of those Mt. Elden. There used to be a lovely spring up in there.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh.

MRS. ANNA HART: And Ft. Valley that was at the foot of the <San Francisco Peaks>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You talked about Schultz Pass, ah…

MRS. ANNA HART: We used to go horseback riding ______ horses.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, you did. Just a bunch of kids would go out?

MRS. ANNA HART: Uh huh. Lots of horses.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were there a lot of sheep around in this area?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh, yeah. They would bring them up here in the summer and take them to <Phoenix> in the winter and cattle, awful lot of cattle.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh.

MRS. ANNA HART: And the timber company had two mills, three mills that had, Greenlaw's Mill, FLandM (?), ALandT.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What, the old mill was tucked over…?

MRS. ANNA HART: The ALandT's burned down now; it's gone.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh.

MRS. ANNA HART: And, I don't know what this place is. I think it's run under another name. _______ FLandM. Greenlaw's been tore (sic) down for a long time. Oh yeah. It's like coming into a strange country. (Laughs).

KRISTINE PRENNACE: I'm sure.

MRS. ANNA HART: I never did think that they would ever let the center of <Flagstaff> ever run down like they have. I never would have believed that the sidewalks and the buildings… their yards are not… we always kept up our yards and had nice fences. I remember when they had boardwalks.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh? What were the streets like then? They weren't paved here, then.

MRS. ANNA HART: No, not all of them. I lived on Leroux, way up at the end of Leroux Street there. No, they weren't paved. I remember when they paved them. And we didn't, 1916, 17, there, we had five foot of snow. We didn't have snowplows in those days, either.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah.

MRS. ANNA HART: Just kept the snow shoveled off, you know, and then a path. But we enjoyed it; we didn't know any different.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: No. (Laughs).

MRS. ANNA HART: No, those childhood days, we've seen the best days, I think.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: It was very small town then?

MRS. ANNA HART: Yeah, I think it run around four or five thousand at that time, maybe not quite that many. Of course, there's quite a lumber industry, you know, here.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: When did you get married?

MRS. ANNA HART: I was married in twenty-three.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Your last name "Hart". Are you any relation to the “Hart's Prairie”, Frank Hart, or the <Oak Creek>?

MRS. ANNA HART: Yeah, the <Sedona>. My husband, L.E. Hart, my husband's father, he owned an awful lot of property down in <Sedona>. He used to be supervisor here and he run the County Hospital. My husband was superintendent of the County Hospital.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was that like?

MRS. ANNA HART: Well that was the old hospital. It used to be over here where the Pine Hotel is. Then they built it out north, I guess, yeah that's north isn't it. I've lived in <Los Angeles>, and I don't know east, west or north. I know where I'm a goin', and that's about all I do know.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was… as supervisor, what was his duties?

MRS. ANNA HART: He was supervisor. He run that county.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: He did, he ran the administration.

MRS. ANNA HART: Uh huh. He was supervisor. His father did first and then he did.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were they tied in then with the Hart Prairie Harts, Mr. L. E. Hart?

MRS. ANNA HART: L.E. Hart.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was he a brother or son?

MRS. ANNA HART: Who?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Ah, okay your…

MRS. ANNA HART: Mr husband was William, William C. Hart. His father was L.E. Hart.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. And were they any relation to Frank Hart?

MRS. ANNA HART: No. Well, there used to be an "O.L. Hart" here a Les Hart.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were they sheepherders?

MRS. ANNA HART: No, I think there were all cattle.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: All cattle, uh huh.

MRS. ANNA HART: Piper, Piper was ah, he had a saloon over here on Front Street.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh, okay.

MRS. ANNA HART: He, he had sheep.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Were there a lot of Hart relatives then in <Flagstaff>?

MRS. ANNA HART: Hart, what?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Relatives, you know brothers or, was it a big family?

MRS. ANNA HART: No, they was (sic) Fred and Ira and our Harts. Fred and Ira and William C. Hart. That's all. They weren't any kin to the rest of the Harts.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. Can you describe the down town area a little bit? You started to and then I think I got you off the track about what it was like down town?

MRS. ANNA HART: Well, the Methodist Church used to sit over there in that part. And then the bank, they moved the Methodist building up here, and the bank, Tom Pollock ran the bank over there. And there was a rooming house here.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Right across the street here from the Weatherford.

MRS. ANNA HART: Dan Francis lived over there. And my mother's sister's husband used to be sheriff here, Charlie Bush. They lived down at the end of the block in a big home there. And there was a doctor's office over on that corner, Dr. Miller. The courthouse is still up there, but they've ruined that, now.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Adding on to it, or…?

MRS. ANNA HART: Yeah, the front of it, they just ruined it. And I've heard other people make the same remark.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was it sitting out by itself pretty much then, or…?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh yeah.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: There weren't other buildings around.

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh yeah. The jail was, it's the same place as it is now. The other Post Office has been moved now. The Post Office used to be on the next street over there. Then they moved it over there. Now they moved it a way down there.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: So, it was pretty much all over.

MRS. ANNA HART: Yeah.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was it like the Post Office?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh, we had a very nice Post Office when they built that. And that's the same building over there. They haven't… the Masonic Temple, that's the same over there… And Babbitts' used to have a garage right across the street from there. And Babbitts' had a store there; dry goods, groceries and every thing on that corner down there.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Right. Pretty much where they are now. It was just a different building. How often did you get your mail there?

MRS. ANNA HART: Huh?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: How often did you get mail in?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh, we got our mail every day.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did it come in on the train?

MRS. ANNA HART: Better mail service in those days than you get now.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did it come in from the train then, or did they ride it in on horses.

MRS. ANNA HART: I guess it all come in by train. No, it wasn't trucked in. Now, I believe all the mail's mostly all trucked. Mail system's gone to pieces, you know. We never had no trouble with our mail.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was the train depot about the same?

MRS. ANNA HART: The Santa Fe's always been over there.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: That was the same structure the same building. How many passenger trains came through?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh, we used to have lots of passenger trains freight trains. Now, I believe you only have two a day.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yes.

MRS. ANNA HART: One in the morning and one at night going. Now they've ruined the railroads, too, all the airplanes. They can have them.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you travel by train, now?

MRS. ANNA HART: Well, by train or bus whenever I go. No air planes for me.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What did you do for entertainment? Were there shows or…?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh yeah. This show here. We've always had this Orpheum. And it went down when we had that five foot of snow.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: It just collapsed. What year was that?

MRS. ANNA HART: In 1916 '17, I guess it was, no,'16, well it was close on. It was in December and then it set off in January into a rain.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What did they show there? What type of…?

MRS. ANNA HART: Well, they weren't talking pictures in those… all-silent pictures thing. They had a little bit of vaudeville, not too much. But I never was, I never attended shows very much. My folks didn't allow us to go to shows, too much. They had a skating rink.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Where was that?

MRS. ANNA HART: That was over on Front Street.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: On Front Street. Did it cost anything to go skating?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh yes. I don't know how much. I never was allowed to go to skating rinks, either. And then, they had a dance hall down on in the next block over on that corner, quite a big dance hall.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What kind of dances did they hold there?

MRS. ANNA HART: Well, I don't know. I wasn't allowed to go to dances, either.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh you didn't.

MRS. ANNA HART: But they had, oh, once in awhile I was allowed to go look on. They had mostly waltzes, and none of this stuff that they've got now. I don't call it dancing just jumping up and down and hollering. Too old for that.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did they mainly have waltzes, or did they have square dances?

MRS. ANNA HART: They had beautiful waltzing then really dancing. And it's coming back, I believe. Over in <Los Angeles>, I know it is. What it was. While this stuff is dying out.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Where there many restaurants down town here?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh yeah. Well there was Chinese not too many white. Chinese over by Black's Saloon. It was a big Chinese restaurant. It wasn't too many restaurants around here. But then, they didn't go out. It wasn't lazy like they are.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: (Laughs). Did you have like an old wood stove or…?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh yeah. All wood stove; coal stoves. It was all… I guess they had done this; it's all gas now, isn't it?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: And electricity, I guess.

MRS. ANNA HART: Gas and electric. I don't know. I haven't been in the homes so I don't know what they have now, but I understand that the gas is piped in here. <Texas> or some place, I think.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: And you mainly got around, how, by…?

MRS. ANNA HART: Yeah.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well, did you walk, or horse and buggy?

MRS. ANNA HART: Nothing like the old wood stoves. Food tastes better on them.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. (Laughs).

MRS. ANNA HART: You're not old enough to know, but they do. We ironed off wood. First came out with the whole iron handle, and then they come out with the wooden handle that clamped on the irons, before we had the electric iron. Mother did the ironing on a wood stove. I wished I didn't have such a good memory, you look back. They say you never want to look back, but you can't help, you see modern times now and see how it's changed, uh uh. Still we had happier days; the happiest. Their not satisfied with what… Christmas we got a stocking of candy or orange or banana, and made our own candies and stuff like that. We enjoyed what we got. Now, they're never satisfied with anything. They commercialize Christmas and, you know, New Years and Thanksgiving. And our gifts… we embroidered stuff to give. Now, if you don't give the very best, why people… I think that's terrible, go and exchange Christmas gifts. Too old fashioned.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh it's nice. Did you have like a regular tradition the way you went about celebrating Christmas?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh yes. Our churches always had a Christmas tree and celebrated. The folks… Mother cooked in November, made our fruit cakes and stuff like that, you know. Now, everything's bought and prepared. You didn't then. In fact, I think they'll finally do away with other holidays.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you have like big dinners and things?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh yes. We always had our turkey dinners and invited out to neighbors, you know.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What did you do when you went to the neighbor's house?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh, we had little games that we played; the children did. There was no fighting or fussing.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What kind of games did you play?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh, I don't know now. We used to play "hide and go seek", just little games, you know. Now, they have to get in cars and run around. We didn't have cars.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Right. What type of people would you meet just going down the street in <Flagstaff> when you were a youngster?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh, white people. There was quite a few Mexican; the mills employed them, but no colored. There was only two colored families. ______ _____. No Japs. We had Chinese. Chinese laundry and ______ ______ Chinese restaurants. _______ ______ white. (Background noise).

KRISTINE PRENNACE: All white.

MRS. ANNA HART: Now, you don't hear your own language.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well, you left <Flagstaff> when… nineteen twenties, would you say, first? When did you first leave <Flagstaff>?

MRS. ANNA HART: Well, I told you around '23. _______ ______.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. And then you've come back ______.

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh yeah, but not to stay not to live. _______ _______.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: When did you start noticing the big changes occurring in <Flagstaff>?

MRS. ANNA HART: Well, I, they hadn't built… when my mother died in '39, they hadn't built ______ ______. It was just about the same in '39. Then from that time on, why I wasn't here then for seventeen years, I never seen it. That’s when big change, I guess…

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Within that seventeen years. Uh huh.

MRS. ANNA HART: Within that seventeen years. And I never heard my father ever… as I say, he'd come back and forth, go back and forth to <California>. It seemed to me I never heard him make a remark about it, and that was in '47 when he was killed. I never heard him say very much about change in <Flagstaff>, either. I kind of imagine it was in the forties when they began to change <Flagstaff>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Other than the buildings, anything else just really strike you when you come back, a change?

MRS. ANNA HART: Well no. They tore this place down to where it don't even look like it was. That, that looks… 'cause we used to have a sign across on that side that built in 1898. That's all been stone. They've taken that down.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did your father cut the stone for that?

MRS. ANNA HART: Uh uh.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Which buildings that are still standing did your father help do stone work on?

MRS. ANNA HART: Well, he done a lot of stone work for the Catholic Church. I don't remember, I guess he did put the stone for the Commercial (ed: Hotel) that burned down, too. Stone work. Stone fences. But, I noticed coming down Leroux Street, Babbitts' had a big rock fence, I see that's all been torn down, and a lot of things been torn on buildings all along Leroux. Tom Pollock's house was still there; M.I. Powers house is still there; Jack Diamond's house is still there; our old home is still there. Of course, they've remodeled that on the outside, some.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was the address of your old home?

MRS. ANNA HART: Huh?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: The address of your home?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh, I don't remember.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You don't remember. It was just on north Leroux. Uh huh. But it's still…

MRS. ANNA HART: I know where it's at, I can walk right to it, but as far as… it was on Leroux.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. Was the residential area real close in, or has a lot of that…?

MRS. ANNA HART: Kellers and… had a home right down here in the middle of this block. They run the candy factory over… or candy and bakery shop. Then our residence… I mean when Uncle Charley was sheriff, that was right on the corner, and the doctor's office on there, and Dr. Manning, he lived in the next block, his son Tom. Manning, the old doctor lived up here by the public school. There's residence all around, right on…

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Real keep close, uh huh. You said that there wasn't a library when you were growing up?

MRS. ANNA HART: I don't remember where the library was unless it was in the masonic temple over there. We never visited the library very much.

END TAPE 1, SIDE 1, BEGIN TAPE 1, SIDE 2

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. So you did do a lot, your chores probably took most of your time.

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh yes.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What, can we talk about the Weatherford? Did you stay here in 1915, you had a room here, or…?

MRS. ANNA HART: Well in the snow.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, you came in and stayed in here.

MRS. ANNA HART: I was in here, I worked for the telephone company right down there.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh.

MRS. ANNA HART: And I couldn't get home, so I stayed here at the Weatherford ______ _______. There was two of us girls caught______ ______.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was it like on the inside? You say it was a lot different then.

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh, well we always had… they had a switch board, they had telephones. They don't have telephones here now. The rooms have changed ______. They've kept it up pretty good.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was it… the walls were painted or were they wall papered, or…?

MRS. ANNA HART: Well I… sure, everything was wall papered. ______ ______ _______. They've remodeled some. _______ ______. But we had nicer lobby(?). They've changed the lobby here, and the desk wasn't clear back. _______ ______ ______. That's the only time I ever stayed in the hotels when I couldn't get home.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh. Do you remember who owned the Weatherford then?

MRS. ANNA HART: Weatherford owned it, Hugh Weatherford, and then I don't know, I think the Devines run it for awhile, Andy Devine, you know that show man?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh.

MRS. ANNA HART: His folks, then they moved to Kingman. They owned the hotel in Kingman. But it's always been the Weatherford. I don't know, I guess they're all dead, now. Hugh was a little older than I.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: He was running it then, Hugh was?

MRS. ANNA HART: I don't know whether Hugh… no, the old man was running it.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh the…

MRS. ANNA HART: I don't remember him, distinctly. But I believe someone said that Hugh had taken it over afterwards, _______ _______. Been sold, I guess, two or three times. I don't know.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did they have a lot of people working here then?

MRS. ANNA HART: No, not too many.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What kind of services?

MRS. ANNA HART: They had a good service in those days. And I remember when they built the Monte Vista. Gee it wasn't the tourist town at that time; they made it a tourist town. Prices are higher here. Food prices here are not quite as high as they are in <California>, but when it comes to rent, it's just a highway robbery. Just a HIGHWAY robbery, because they'd catch them in the summer time, and in the winter time there's not much here; not much traffic. Then they've taken so many of the sawmills away, you see. It used to be the big industry here, and the cattle.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah.

MRS. ANNA HART: Cattle and sheep man, but I guess there's not many… much of it now. Babbitts' used to have a big slaughterhouse up here.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Right by the train?

MRS. ANNA HART: Over, east down there(?). It was a whole lot(?) of slaughterin' and all their meat _______ I don’t know. _______ _______ residence or motels or something, that's all they care about are the motels. They only had one hospital and that was the ALandT company hospital and the county hospital, but that's all. But, community… I don't even know who runs that, who runs whether it's the city or what. You've got a very nice hospital here. _______ _______ _______.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was… did you mainly take care of yourselves at home or…?

MRS. ANNA HART: Huh?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you mainly take care of yourselves at home when you were ill before, or what was the medical situation?

MRS. ANNA HART: Where, you mean…?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: When you were growing up here in Flag.

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh, I was at home those times(?).

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well, I mean if you got sick?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh, my mother had taken care of us. We never went, we didn't run to hospitals in those days. If they was… most all operations, serious operations was done in <Albuquerque>, and <Phoenix>, I think they did some operations. People weren't sick in those days like they are now. 'Course there are more people now, too, than there were in those days. But several of them was taken to <Albuquerque> _______ _______. _______ _______ cuttin' ________, and now there's too much cuttin'.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What, oh back to the Weatherford, did they have like lighting, what kind of lighting did they have in the rooms?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh well they've had electricity.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You had electricity?

MRS. ANNA HART: Yeah. Out in the farming districts, they all used coal oil lamps, you know. Oh yeah, as long as I can remember they've had electricity.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: And the plumbing, was it inside plumbing or…?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh yes. _______ we always had plumbing. They got little small bath tubs here. I know when I stayed here, I asked my dad, I said, "Those are the smallest bath tubs I ever seen." He says, well you're lucky, he says, they're better than the wash tubs. You know, when we were kids, they even washed in them. You don't remember, but I do. Wash tubs in kitchens where it was warm, oh yeah. Yeah, well I guess they've had to repair quite a bit of this; it's seventy-seven years old so they've had to put in new pipes and stuff, I guess _______ plumbing too, I imagine. Of course you've got good water here, you don't have the water that we have in Imperial. That alkali just eats the pipes right up over there.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh. What… was there a big water shortage when you were growing up in <Flagstaff>?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh no.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You didn't have…?

MRS. ANNA HART: We never had no trouble with water, no we had all this snow. We had… you don't have no snows here like we used to. Then they built the big reservoir out there. We only had one at one time. Then they built that great big. I think you have three now if I'm not mistaken, haven't you? Three reservoirs? But you have been short of water.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Occasionally.

MRS. ANNA HART: There's always been snow on the other side of the peaks the whole year around. When you go to the <Grand Canyon> you could always see the backs of them was always covered with snow. No we never had no… it was just in later years, some of the springs went dry. I know when my mother was still alive, they had an awful shortage of water. They even shipped it in from <Winslow> at one time, I know. My mother told me about that, because I was living in <California>. We're short of water over there, now.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh.

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh yeah, we haven't had no rain this winter at all. I don't know what they're going to do this summer. Their talking about cutting them off from watering their lawns and _______ ______. ______ _______.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh.

MRS. ANNA HART: _______ _______ ______ . (ED: Outside traffic noise.)

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What kind of city government was there, like was there a mayor, or…?

MRS. ANNA HART: Huh?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was there a mayor of the city, do you remember?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh, I suppose there was, I never paid no attention. I know we had the sheriff. I went to school with Carl Dickinson, he used to be sheriff here, and that's about all I know. Three-nine, I remember that distinctly was the sheriff's office. Called it bits of many things. I remember quite a bit of the numbers, the old numbers. We had supervisors here, I remember that; firemen.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was the fire department like?

MRS. ANNA HART: Well they had a… they had a pretty… then after cars come out, you know, of course they had automobiles, but otherwise, we never had many fires in those days.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember the rest of <Arizona> very much, like was there very much communication between <Phoenix> and <Flagstaff>, or what was the feeling in <Flagstaff> towards <Phoenix>?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh yeah, when I worked the telephone office there, there for years they never had no direct line to <Winslow> and we checked <Williams>. The ah… and long distance(?), we had <Williams> and <Flagstaff>. But <Winslow> used to have to come up through <Flagstaff> and go around through <Phoenix> to go out east. But now, they had a… it's been before I left, they had a direct line from <Winslow> east. They didn't have to come through <Phoenix>. <Phoenix> always put on repeaters down there. They've improved in their, in their telephone wires to what it used to be. _______ _______. Everything, I guess, would be east, and the west and on the toll. Mostly I liked it better than I did local.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: As a child, did you ever go to <Phoenix>?

MRS. ANNA HART: Huh?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: As a child, did you ever go down to <Phoenix>?

MRS. ANNA HART: No. I've never been to <Phoenix>, capitol. I come through there three years ago, on the bus, and that's the only time I've ever been there. But it's quite a city now, they say. It's a regular city what it used to be. We talked to <Phoenix>, we always give the weather report. See, I went to work at six o'clock in the morning and always had to give the weather report, you know, <Phoenix>, <Ash Fork>, <Prescott>, _______ _______ ______.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Can you remember any natural disasters like the flood or…

MRS. ANNA HART: Yeah, we had several floods from the Peaks up there. And one time the whole south end was under water. They had the River de Flag. I see they've closed that up; no river runs down here. Now the bridge is still there across from the school. I've been all up and around through there, and… Yeah, we had three cloud bursts, three cloud bursts that I remember of. Oh, no drowning or anything, but it was flooded quite… went over the Santa Fe railroad tracks, the bridge there. But as far as that goes, we had no disaster. The floods, I understand(?), got into some people's houses, but they build it here(?), in here they build their houses up on foundations. Over in <California>, they're built right down on the ground.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, you were talking about the Rio de Flag, did it used to be just bank to bank type water, or…?

MRS. ANNA HART: Well, whenever they have a cloud burst on the mountain. I've seen two cloud bursts.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was there water running through there regularly when you were going to school?

MRS. ANNA HART: No. In the summertime it would run a little stream through, not too bad, you know, the snow would melt and run down. I don't know how they ever checked that, 'cause that was quite a river there, especially when it went over the banks.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, it used to go out over the banks.

MRS. ANNA HART: Yeah.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you have any other favorite memories of <Flagstaff> or feelings about it?

MRS. ANNA HART: No, I think I've told you about everything I ever knew.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Any special, just child hood story that you can recall?

MRS. ANNA HART: I had a happy childhood, I guess. I could look back and see now I was happy. Of course when you are young, you don't realize it until after you get older. I was very happy here, because I didn't know anything else.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh um, I wanted to talk a little bit about your church, you were a Seventh Day Adventist. Were there very many church members?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh yes. It was a pretty good congregation, but I understand there isn't very many now.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Would you say, like a hundred members, or…?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh yes, we had quite a few members(?). People moving in and out and built out around. Now they've got a church built way out of town, I don't know why.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember, was there an East <Flagstaff> before? Do you remember when that was developed out there?

MRS. ANNA HART: No, that's all been built. Oh, there's ranches down in there, you know, out on Sixty-six Highway, going to <Tuba City> and then to <Winslow> and _______, but now I guess it's built up solid. I haven't been(?) up _______ _______. Only when I went back east on the train, and I could see from the train how it was all built up.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: But there wasn't anything there when you were young. No. It was just ranching out in there?

MRS. ANNA HART: All, all ranches.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: When did you know… well you went away. It was thirty-nine when your mom died, and you came back. Was there any development out there then?

MRS. ANNA HART: I don't think there was(?). <Flagstaff>, <Arizona>'s a healthy state. You can say that. I mean the northern part, I don't know nothing about the southern part; do know the northern part. I was always healthy when I was here, but I sure lost my health over in <California>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh.

MRS. ANNA HART: And it's worse now than it ever was with that smog. I'm over here now, and the doctor's at ________ so I don't know what I'm going to do Monday, he takes another spot on the lung. So I think I've got a pretty good doctor over here, but it's a little high altitude, he said, here. But I don't know much difference in the breathing than I do over there only I breathe fresh air over here. Over there it's smog. Oh yeah, you can see I've been butchered up here terrible.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh. Do you… this is a little out off the subject, but do you remember China Canyon back in the 1920s? Oh, you left in twenty-three. But do you remember any development? China Canyon?

MRS. ANNA HART: China.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: China Canyon.

MRS. ANNA HART: No. Don't think I ever heard of it.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Didn't you? It was probably developed afterwards.

MRS. ANNA HART: Out near the <Grand Canyon>?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: No, it was within town.

MRS. ANNA HART: No, I never heard of that. <Walnut Canyon> down east. No, I've noticed in the <Los Angeles> paper ever once in awhile different names in <Arizona> I never even heard tell of.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, well I think…

MRS. ANNA HART: But I would like to see the <Glen Canyon> out there; dam.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh huh.

MRS. ANNA HART: I would like to see that before I go.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: When you went out to the <Grand Canyon>, was there any place to stay out there?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh no, we used to camp out when we went to the <Grand Canyon>. The El Tovar and hotels, we never stayed at the hotels, because I was young then. A bunch of us kids would go, you know. My dad worked over there, out there, a couple of years. (Sound obscured by traffic noise). But now they've got regular camping grounds, I guess, and things equipped. But they used to… they didn't… they just camped right out on the ground.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you ever go down into the canyon?

MRS. ANNA HART: No. No that's one thing, he would never let me go, and I wouldn't go down anyway. No, I don't like… I get a funny feeling when I even look out of a window down. I guess they still use the burros, pack burros.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did they have those?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh ______. They're sure footed, you know, that's why they'd send several of them; they'd rope them all together. I don't know whether they do now or not. If one went over, the whole string would go over. _______ ______. Burros are sure footed. That trail isn't very wide. ______ _______ you could look down to the half way house seven and a half miles. I haven't looked down there. No I wouldn't, that don't interest me. (Both laugh). I've been to the top of the <San Francisco Peaks>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You did? When you were real young?

MRS. ANNA HART: I went on horseback then.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You could take the horses all the way up?

MRS. ANNA HART: _______.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Would you stay up there awhile?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh no. No, we didn't spend ______ ______.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: _______.

MRS. ANNA HART: No. The <Grand Canyon> in my estimation, according to the size… <Oak Creek Canyon> is prettier than the <Grand Canyon> to me, of course that's a monstrous canyon, of course, but according to the size, I'd rather any day go down to <Oak Creek>. I've caught many a fish in <Oak Creek>, Lake Mary and all those.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember when Lake Mary was developed?

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh no, I don't remember, but I know I was a mighty small kid when we'd go out there fishing.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, so it was already…

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh yes, it's been there a long time.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was Mary Riordan older than you, or younger?

MRS. ANNA HART: Huh?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Mary Riordan, older than you, do you remember?

MRS. ANNA HART: Riordan?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: The one that Lake Mary was named after.

MRS. ANNA HART: Oh I don't… oh yeah, she was ______ _____.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: She was.

MRS. ANNA HART: I think Lake Mary went dry one year here. Some of them said it went dry.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: There was always plenty of water in it when you were a kid.

MRS. ANNA HART: Yeah, uh huh. I caught many a fish there and many a one in <Oak Creek>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What kind of fish?

MRS. ANNA HART: Trout, they had trout. We used to take sun perch and catfish, mud cat fish out of Lake Mary.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh.

MRS. ANNA HART: I don't know what they catch out there now. Well that's the history of <Flagstaff>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, you can't…

MRS. ANNA HART: My history.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well that’s very interesting. Okay you think that's about it.
