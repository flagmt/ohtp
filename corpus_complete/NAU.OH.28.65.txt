[Narrator's wife, although not identified by name, is also present and makes significant contributions to the interview. (Tr.)] 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, Mr. Jakle, when and where were you born? 



CARTER JAKLE: <St. Louis Missouri>. When? November 13, 1902. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Who were your parents? 



CARTER JAKLE: My father was Augustine William Jakle. My mother was Maude Hines. M A U D E, Maude Hines, H I N E S. They were married in 1900. In fact, I have their wedding certificate here in the house. I'll show it to you before you leave. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah that’d be great! Now, when did they come to <Flagstaff>? 



CARTER JAKLE: Well, they lived in <St. Louis>. My dad had bronchial trouble or something, and the doctors told 'em to come out west. So they came to <Williams Arizona>. And from <Williams Arizona>, they moved to <Oakland>. At <Oakland> they had a chance of going to either <Flagstaff>, or I think a town in <New Mexico>. And Mom said - that's my mother - "<Flagstaff>," because she knew Dr. Raymond. Maybe you've heard of Dr. Raymond in your discussions. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, I've just heard his name. 



CARTER JAKLE: So we came to <Flagstaff> and Dad was workin' with the Santa Fe Railroad. He was a railroad employee. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, that was <Oakland California> that they moved here? 



CARTER JAKLE: From <Oakland> they came to <Flagstaff>, in 1907, as I was always told. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: So you were just very, very young. 



CARTER JAKLE: Yes, I hardly remember it. (laughs) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did they come by train? 



CARTER JAKLE: Train, oh yes. That was the only way of traveling in those days, train. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Or wagon, I guess. 



MRS. JAKLE: Well, they had passes too. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh that’s right. If you worked for the railroad, then you got your travel free? 



CARTER JAKLE: Well, I guess Dad had a pass. I don't know, really. I imagine they traveled free, with a pass. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: So he worked for the railroad then in <Flagstaff>? 



CARTER JAKLE: He worked for the railroad in <St. Louis>. I don't know, he worked - about 1909 he was offered a position with Babbitt Brothers and took it and stayed there. So he moved from the Santa Fe to Babbitt Brothers. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What type of work did he do for the Santa Fe? 



CARTER JAKLE: I think he was what they called cashier. He was also, from what I understand, a Wells Fargo agent. That's what… some friends have gone into Wells Fargo and they had a picture of Dad, and they said he was a Wells Fargo agent… went to Wells Fargo on the Santa Fe sort of, with the express company. They all worked hand in hand. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: So then he worked for Babbitts' the rest of the time until his retirement or death? 



CARTER JAKLE: Yes. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, what did he do with Babbitts'? 



CARTER JAKLE: Well, he went up as a cashier there, too, and then he worked up… he was an officer of the company when he retired, assistant treasurer. He [grew?] with the company, the same as I did. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, so then you started working with Babbitts' also? 



CARTER JAKLE: Oh, yeah. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: You spent your whole time working with Babbitts'? 



CARTER JAKLE: No, I was missin' two years. I went to the ALandT Company, Arizona Lumber and Timber Company. I spent two years up there, '24 to '26 I guess it was. But the rest of the time, I was with the company. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh boy, yeah. Now, I'm sure you can remember what Babbitts'… Oh, was there something? 



MRS. JAKLE: (inaudible) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well, if it's something.... 



MRS. JAKLE: Yeah, I'll tell you about it. It'll be interesting to tell, how many years, and what he finally did. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, okay. 



CARTER JAKLE: Well, we haven't come to that yet. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, that's okay, go ahead. 



CARTER JAKLE: I thought… What was it? I started to work for Babbitts' when I was a kid, about thirteen years old, in the summertime. I worked in the shoe department, and I worked as, you know, clerks, and about seventeen, I got a summer job and just stayed with it. I stayed there 'til I retired. I worked for 'em for about fifty years. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: That's a long time. Were you in the office then? 



CARTER JAKLE: Uh-huh, I was in the office. I was the first office boy they ever had. ____ and I left; I was the chief accounting officer of the company. 



MRS. JAKLE: And the vice (?). 



CARTER JAKLE: And vice-president and member of the board of directors. (laughing) still could go to the meeting if I want to. I mean, I'm not a member of the board of directors, but I know 'em all and they are very nice to me - something I appreciate very much. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, well, I might just continue asking you questions about Babbitts' then, and what it was like when your father started working there in 1909 - if you can remember at all. 



CARTER JAKLE: Well, it really wasn't much different, I guess, than when I started. The town was small. He worked in the cashier's cage there, and he had silver dollars and gold pieces and big currency, and no pennies. He didn't handle pennies in those days. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: You didn't? 



CARTER JAKLE: No. But we still acted… the store cashed checks, that was the half bank, and we accepted money, even, such as a bank would, and put it on deposit for the customer. A lot of customers paid their bills once a year - the cattle people when they sold their cattle. And it was just, I guess, an ordinary run store in a small town in the West. Of course you have heard and probably know something about the history of the Babbitt organizations. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Why don't you go ahead and give it to me, but from your point of view, or what you remember of it. 



CARTER JAKLE: What? 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember much about the Babbitt history? 



CARTER JAKLE: Well, I KNEW them all. I knew the five original owners. I knew 'em personally; in fact, Mr. C.J. Babbitt was a good friend of mine. And I knew the second generation, and I was very close to Mr. C.J. Babbitt's sons, Jimmy and John. Jimmy was my age. We played together before we went to school. He was I suppose you know, killed in a hunting accident over in back… in the year the war started - '41 or somethin' like that. And then I found Mr. JOHN Babbitt; perhaps you've heard of, I've known him since he was born. (laughs) He was I remember an ornery mule when he was a baby. We were very friendly all the time. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: They didn't spend much time in <Flagstaff>, growing up. 



CARTER JAKLE: No, about the time that we started to school, they went to <Los Angeles>, and would only come back in the summertime. But Jimmy and I were always friends, and when he came back in the summer, why, we'd play and, well, whatever was going on, and have [fun?]. (laughing obscures remainder of comment) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: You pointed out the picture of Mr. George Babbitt's home. What was that like? 



CARTER JAKLE: Wonderful place, beautiful place. It opened up into a great big entry room that was big. And from that there was what they called the billiard room, and it had a very high ceiling, and a pool table in there, of course. And as a child at Christmastime… we were invited up there during the Christmas week, and they had a tree that went to the ceiling, and there'd be little gifts for us - you know, the people that were there. It was something to looked forward to, it was quite fun. It was - well, there's no house in <Flagstaff> like it, I guess - not now. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Other people I've talked to, I've really kind of got an understanding that Babbitts had a very big impact, I think, on almost everyone's lives in <Flagstaff>. 



CARTER JAKLE: Well, no, I wouldn't say that. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: You don't think so? 



CARTER JAKLE: No. Maybe in the early days, they did, but later it wasn't so much - at least I don't think so. That is, they got blamed for a lot of things. They didn't do it. Anything wrong, they'd get blamed for it… the Babbitts. But the good things, well, somebody else took the credit. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh-huh. 



CARTER JAKLE: But they were retiring people - especially the first generation. 



MRS. JAKLE: Wasn't Mr. C.J. mayor of the town? 



CARTER JAKLE: No. 



MRS. JAKLE: It was in one of these books. 



CARTER JAKLE: Dave was. 



MRS. JAKLE: Oh, Dave, uh-huh. 



CARTER JAKLE: But… no. C.J. and George were retiring people, and Billy Babbitt was out with the cattle most of the time - you didn't see much of him. 



MRS. JAKLE: One of my first memories was Charlie's mother telling ______ George, close friends, and George helped her build her home, and they built right at the foot of the hill. I mean, helped design it. Sort of [took her under her wing?] because she was much older than Charlie's mother. When I first went to <Flagstaff>, the first person to give a party for me after I was married was Mrs. George in the big home. It was almost ________ habit to continue to inviting close friends and family up for Christmas dances and Christmas parties. I remember that very well, for several years in the late twenties. CJ remembers the earlier years; I remember the twenties and thirties. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Right. 



CARTER JAKLE: It was quite a house that… I remember after Mr. George died - I've forgotten the year he died - but his mother went to the coast, and their son, Herb Babbitt, was the only one in town. So she asked my mother if I would stay with her, so _________. She was nervous because her husband had dropped dead. So I spent a winter up in that house. When Herb was there, I was gone; and when Herb was gone, I was there. But it was a big place, and the wind would blow, and it was sort of weird - great big rooms. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: They were way up there on the mesa? Is that…? 



CARTER JAKLE: Well, the road runs up Fine and San Francisco - the road… perhaps you know where it is. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh! Now, I'm not sure. 



CARTER JAKLE: Fine and San Francisco. You know where Doc Barnes' old place is up there? That big - on Pine? 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: I think… It's just a very small road that runs up? 



CARTER JAKLE: No, I'm not even sure the road's up there anymore. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, but that's where it used to be, was over in there. I know where the area is. 



CARTER JAKLE: Up there over the hill. And our house was at the foot of the hill at the corner of Fine and San Francisco. And in THOSE days, 1912, we went up there. There wasn't anything across the street. Of course we grazed a cow over there; used to stake a cow out. But at our house we had chickens, we had this cow, and we had planted potatoes on the north side of the house. There wasn't anybody else around there. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: No one else around that area. 



CARTER JAKLE: Well, it's wooden sidewalks… no paved streets. But it's pretty much like it is right now, except for the paved streets. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: And all the houses! (laughs) 



CARTER JAKLE: More houses! But some of the houses have been there - that's where Mr. Compton lived. I think that was there in 1912. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, I'm living there now in his old house. So it is very old. Okay, let me see who were your closest neighbors then, other than the Babbitts? 



CARTER JAKLE: Closest neighbors? 



MRS. JAKLE: (whispers something, inaudible) 



CARTER JAKLE: Verkamps lived up a couple of houses from us. Across the street, Harley Yaeger was a sheep man. And then Tom Fryer lived across the way where Joe Babbitt built a house. The Hermans were down a block. 



MRS. JAKLE: The Pollocks. 



CARTER JAKLE: Pollocks were over further on Leroux Street. 



MRS. JAKLE: About a block, uh-huh. 



CARTER JAKLE: That was called Knob Hill at one time by the people of <Flagstaff>. Tom Pollock and Milt Powers lived up there. You know, Knob Hill from <San Francisco> - they said that was Knob Hill up the top of Leroux Street. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: So that started out as kind of a joke, then, right? 



MRS. JAKLE: When we were first married, we wanted to live up on the hill. It was a dead end street, San Francisco. And the children could play cops and robbers and run all over the hill, you know, which is now Pinecrest. And even OUR eldest children, they're almost shocked when they see the old road that went out to the Snow Bowl and instead of just cornstalks and fields that belonged to Margaret [Prizell?], you know.... 



CARTER JAKLE: Dairy. 



MRS. JAKLE: Dairy out there - why, it's just houses. 



CARTER JAKLE: Oh, out there, Tom Pollock had a racetrack ________. We called it [Mortgage?] Flat. (all talking at once, none discernable) 



CARTER JAKLE: Where that dairy, Matson's Dairy, was out there, but Tom Pollack had a racetrack. He used to run horses, breed horses. And of course Tom Pollock was at one time the richest man in <Arizona>, I suppose. And in fact, C.J… Maybe I shouldn't say this, so we'll forget it. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, well, ______________. 



CARTER JAKLE: It might not sound good repeated. 



MRS. JAKLE: The Locketts were out there, too. 



CARTER JAKLE: Oh, the Locketts have been there for a long time. 



MRS. JAKLE: (both talking at once) _____________ but you know where that is, you've heard all about it. 



CARTER JAKLE: That's down where the museum is. 



MRS. JAKLE: That's all Locketts' out there - still much of it is, and some's being developed _______ out in there. When I first went to <Flagstaff> in 1924 to go to college, we used to hike out past what we called the old poor farm, which is now the museum. I guess you've heard that, county poor house. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, it was just like a rest home or something, wasn't it? 



MRS. JAKLE: I don't know, because it was before my time, but I do remember that when we hiked up, we'd say, "Well, we'll hike as far as the poor house." 



CARTER JAKLE: That's what they called the poor house, the poor farm. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember when it was… 



CARTER JAKLE: Oh, yeah, it was there, as far as I knew, forever. 



MRS. JAKLE: After the Depression, it changed… 



CARTER JAKLE: Well, then they had these welfare programs and so on, and the county started payin' for it, for hospital care for 'em. Then they stopped that. I suppose it was run down and getting expensive anyway. You know? ( 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh-huh.) 



CARTER JAKLE: Those things would. And then they turned it into this Pioneers Home, or Pioneer Museum, or something. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any of the old town people that ended up out there? 



CARTER JAKLE: No. See, that would be before - I would be a kid. I paid no attention. 



MRS. JAKLE: (same time as CJ) Has anyone talked to you about Mamie [McMillan] Fleming? 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: No, uh-uh. 



MRS. JAKLE: She was the first white baby, they say, born in <Flagstaff>. Her home, the McMillan home, is what was Carter's home out at the museum. You know that old one that still stands there. She was a particularly good friend of Carter's family. I mean, well, there were few people. Most people WERE friendly especially those of the Babbitts and the Jakles and the McMillans. 



CARTER JAKLE: Well, in those days, there WEREN'T so many people, and you KNEW everyone. I mean, you WERE family __________. 



MRS. JAKLE: But she was a DEAR woman had a beautiful voice. For years, about twenty-one, I played at the church; she used to be one of the soloists in church. She still has boys, family here, around <Phoenix> now. 



CARTER JAKLE: In fact, [Tommy’s?] got a nice position with the Arizona Bank. He's vice-president. I don't know whether he's [executive?]… 



MRS. JAKLE: As you go into this, you'll find you'll hear more of the McMillans. You read these books, I'm sure you will. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah. 



MRS. JAKLE: I think the CHARM of <Flagstaff>… I remember I fell in love with it, and I've often told Carter I only married him so I could live in <Flagstaff>. It was a picture book town. It was little and it was clean - pristine, sort of, with the snow on the mountains and the church steeples and the school bells. There were so few people, and yet being a college town, it had so much to offer. It wasn't near a city, and it's just sort of by itself, and within just a short time you could be from the snowy country down into <Oak Creek>. In those days, when you went to <Oak Creek>, you might not see another soul. We spent part of our honeymoon there in the old lodge, and we didn't see one soul except the third day I think we came across John Babbitt, fishing. He was on vacation. In ALL of <Oak Creek>! Can you imagine it like that? 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Which lodge did you stay at? 



MRS. JAKLE: It was the old Mayhew Lodge, the one that they had taken the pictures [follow?] the canyon. It was just heavenly, you know - the one that now the government has bought and it's falling apart and they're building houses. You can see what a shame, because it was just a gorgeous _____________. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, I can imagine, because it's STILL beautiful, just the ruins. 



MRS. JAKLE: We spent part of our honeymoon there. People didn't seem to need an awful lot of other people in order to make a success of their lodges. Like the canyon, the few people that , you know. I don't know how the economy worked, but that was the way it was. You didn't have to have a store full of people to run a store. 



CARTER JAKLE: You did the work yourself. 



MRS. JAKLE: As part of it. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah. 



CARTER JAKLE: And down at <Oak Creek>, they had their truck gardens, fruit that sort of stuff. You had a dirt road goin' down there, one-way dirt road. 



MRS. JAKLE: You went down and back the same way __________ so dangerous. It took us eight hours in 1924, between six and eight hours, to go to <Phoenix>. 



CARTER JAKLE: It used to take us TWELVE hours! In fact, I remember when they used to brag, people… they went to <Phoenix> in one day. They left at four in the morning, and they got there about four the next morning. (laughing obscures comment) _________ twenty-four-hour trip. 



MRS. JAKLE: Yeah, narrow road going over the mountains and going to <Williams>, to <Ash Fork>, to <Prescott>, to <Wickenburg>. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah. (laughs) That was rough. Was your mother involved in many civic activities or social life? 



CARTER JAKLE: Yes, she was with the Women's Club, and also with the church group, the Catholic Church. In fact, she was elected queen of somethin'-or-other. 



MRS. JAKLE: _________________. 



CARTER JAKLE: Burning of the mortgage, or something. 



MRS. JAKLE: With all her eight children. 



CARTER JAKLE: No, she worked with the church group all the time. 



MRS. JAKLE: And VERY active in Women's Club. I don't know when she found the time. 



CARTER JAKLE: No, in MY family, see, there were EIGHT of us. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What were your brothers' and sisters' names? 



CARTER JAKLE: Well, they're all married, so I'll give you their last names. Dorothy Bennett, B E N N E T T, and she lives in <Denver>. Mary Cutler, C U T L E R, lives in <Albuquerque>. Loretta Kendall, K E N D A L L, is in <Phoenix>. And Scott [April N.E.?], lives in <Phoenix>. Terese Fronske lives in <Flagstaff>. Her father-in-law is Doc Fronske - or was. And I have a brother, John, who was killed in <Korea>. 



MRS. JAKLE: Colonel Jakle. 



CARTER JAKLE: He was Colonel John Jakle. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, my goodness. 



CARTER JAKLE: And a West Point graduate. He was doin' a mission in <Korea>. And another brother, Ed - Edward - who's a Pan American captain. He flies the South Pacific. Then I came in someplace along the line. I'm the black sheep. (laughs) [I'm the off?] 



MRS. JAKLE: That's false modesty, my dear. 



CARTER JAKLE: Most of 'em are all smart. 



MRS. JAKLE: This might be interesting, if you can scan it. You won't want to go through it now, but after you're through, before you leave. That's a story that Carter's sister, Dorothy, wrote about visiting her grandmother, who also lived in <Flagstaff>. They came out, and how all she walked, and where she went to get to their house. It's really an interesting little story about a child in <Flagstaff> in the early years. I imagine it was about 1912 or '10, maybe. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, yes. Oh, that's neat. I'll look at it, yeah. 



MRS. JAKLE: Has anyone talked to you about skating at Black's Pond? 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: No, uh-uh. Why don't you tell me about that? 



CARTER JAKLE: Okay. In the wintertime, I mean, we had winter sports. We'd go coasting on the hills, or if the weather was good and the ice was good, we'd hike out to Black's Pond, which is where the Elks Club is now. You know where the Elks Club is? (



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh-huh.) 



CARTER JAKLE: That was Black's Pond. So we'd hike out there - day or night, didn't make much difference, there'd be a good crowd of us - and skate. I remember one time, it was the daytime, and the ice wasn't any good on Black's Pond, so we hiked over to where East <Flagstaff> is now, over a couple of mesas, a place called Rowe's [phonetic spelling] Tank. And the ice happened to be good there, so we had a good afternoon, a good day out of it. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Would there be a lot of you, mostly your school friends? 



CARTER JAKLE: Yeah. There'd be ______. I just can't say who, but anybody - the word would get around, "let's go out to Black's Pond." And so everybody that wanted, would go. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did everyone have their own skates and such? 



CARTER JAKLE: Oh, no, nothing was ever provided. Like when I was a kid, we played baseball. (shows photograph) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, my goodness! (laughs) 



MRS. JAKLE: Ted Babbitt's mother's in this picture someplace. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh that’s cute. 



MRS. JAKLE: And this is Carter. And that must have been in the early twenties sometime, before Mr. and Mrs. Raybat [phonetic spelling] were married. She was teaching at the college, up there a lot. That was before I knew Carter, but that's a lot of pictures that are in it, up on Observatory Hill, I think. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, I was gonna say, is that where you mainly went sledding, was over __________? 



CARTER JAKLE: Observatory. That was a big bobsled. There's a little history connected with that bobsled, too, by the way. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: You want to tell me? 



CARTER JAKLE: Well, the bobsled was constructed, or had built. The Dave Babbitt boys had a carpenter or somebody build this bobsled. And the first run down the Observatory Hill, it cracked up. So the Phelan boys took it, and worked it over, and did all the repair work and other work on it, and then they kept it. That's the sled. It'd hold eight people, and we'd come down Observatory Hill on it. It was a good place, because they had wooden snowplows. See, a wedge shaped plow would come down, but that would pack the snow over the road, and it'd make a real good base, and we could really make some time goin' down that hill. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, I bet! 



CARTER JAKLE: Had a few spills. But then, we'd do it daytime or night. I mean, we'd go coasting at night. Later on, then, we took it behind a Model "T" Ford (laughs) and that was fun. But there wasn't the traffic, you see, that you have now, and there was no trouble, no problems. 



I started to say something.... Oh! you said we'd bring our own skates. We provided everything ourselves. We played baseball the summer long, and every kid had his own mitt, and most of 'em had a bat. But the hard part was the baseball. They cost $1.25. That was lots of money! So the gang would get together and we'd go down alleys, collect sacks and bottles until we'd get $1.25 together, and we'd buy a ball and then look for somebody to play. Went over to Mexican town and played the Mexicans. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were there good relations between the Mexicans and [them?]? 



CARTER JAKLE: Oh, sure. We didn't have any race troubles. 



MRS. JAKLE: I taught school, I did some substituting during the war, and that far back, the children were allowed to go where they wanted to. We just didn't have problems, to my knowledge. 



CARTER JAKLE: Oh. Another thing we did in the springtime; played marbles. We had a season for everything. We played marbles down where the Valley National Bank is now, at the corner there of Leroux and Birch. That was a good, level, hard spot there. After school, everybody'd collect down there, and we'd play marbles right out there in the road, in the street. A house where the Valley National Bank is, of course. 



Well, another thing, in those days we used to spin tops. I mean, all in season. That is, when the baseball season was over, you didn't play baseball anymore. Marble season come along, well, you started playing marbles. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: That's neat. 



MRS. JAKLE: Here's a picture of Jimmy Babbitt. He was <Arizona> senator when he died in that hunting tragedy. I guess you know about that, don't you? 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: I don't know much about it. 



MRS. JAKLE: Well, it was just that he went with a group, hunting, and he had a boy who was not used to hunting with him, and a snowstorm came up and Jimmy apparently had a cold, and the boy, he sent him on ahead. When they found Jimmy, he had frozen to death, which is unusual, because he was an experienced hunter. It must have been quick pneumonia or something, because the storm was so severe. At any rate, that's when… then Carter became such a close friend of John's, his younger brother, who took his place. He was appointed to take his place in the senate, and later became president of the senate - or didn't you know that? 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: No! I didn't know that. 



MRS. JAKLE: Oh, yeah, Mr. Babbitt has made a very, VERY popular - John Babbitt - Jim was before him - extremely. After he came back to <Arizona> to practice law, and broke with the company - that's about the time we were married, after _______ through school. He always spent his summers there, and we were close friends. Then after Jimmy died, then John came back from New England, up in the East, where he had been as a stockbroker, and he was younger. We became very, very close friends with him and Mrs. Babbitt. They're about our BEST friends now. Jim was a much more gregarious person than so many of the other Babbitts. I remember when he died, there were just lines of people, just heartbroken to think that he did die. And John has been very active in state affairs. He's on INNUMERABLE boards. You may know that. First Federal and First National Bank. He was for years on the… 



[END TAPE SIDE 1; BEGIN SIDE 2] 



MRS. JAKLE: …different slants, too, you know, about things that he remembers, just about the holidays and things that his father has told him. I'm sure he will. But in this book I was looking through, I came across that picture of Jimmy and his friends. So often they came out - people came from other places that he knew, to visit. <Flagstaff> was such a POPULAR resort. This was Jimmy's little car that Carter bought from him. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, my gosh! 



MRS. JAKLE: Isn't that something?! 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Where was the sandy beach? 



MRS. JAKLE: This is down in <Oak Creek>. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh! uh-huh. 



MRS. JAKLE: Down in <Oak Creek>, where they picnic. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, did you find something? 



CARTER JAKLE: Not particularly, except that's the C.J. Babbitt house where I played as a kid. The Elks bought it, and then it was called the Pink Castle. It was a boarding house. It was across the street from the Catholic Church, on that vacant lot. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: That's where the public library is now, isn't it? 



CARTER JAKLE: I don't think there's anything there. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, the parking lot area? 



CARTER JAKLE: No. It was a union hall. 



MRS. JAKLE: Right downtown? 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: On Cherry and Beaver? 



MRS. JAKLE: Uh-huh. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah. (laughs) That's really different than it is now. 



CARTER JAKLE: You started to ask me… 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, yeah, she mentioned that you had gone to the Grand Canyon when you were very young. 



CARTER JAKLE: Well, I did once. It stayed in recollection there. Some folks came out from <St. Louis> to visit my mother and father. This was about 1912, in there, '13. We went up in a Model "T" Ford, and I think Bill Connolly [phonetic spelling] was the taxi driver, and they rented this car, and there was room for one more, and they took me along. We went to Grandview. There was a hotel at Grandview. We didn't go to El Tovar. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: (inaudible, same time as narrator) Now the Grandview is further East? 



CARTER JAKLE: The Grandview is about twelve miles east of Grand Canyon Village. The road stopped, and we went up and back in a day, and was late getting home. I mean, it was after dark. That's just a faint recollection. Later, of course, we used to go up all the time for picnics and everything else. It was not much of a trip then. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you get to hike around much when you got up there? 



CARTER JAKLE: No. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: You'd just go up there to enjoy the view? 



CARTER JAKLE: These folks from <St. Louis> wanted to see it, and I don't recall much about it, really, except that I remember going up there on a trip; just like I recall going with my father and grandfather to Jerome in a wagon. We went down Schnebly Hill to… camped out at <Cornville>. First place probably was Sedona heading down to <Cornville>, wound up in <Jerome>. Came back, and they were just building Clarkdale. We were gone a week, I guess, or so. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: But <Jerome> was a very busy, bustling town at that time? 



CARTER JAKLE: Oh, yes, it was a mining town. It was lots of people there - half of 'em underground, and half of 'em on top. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well, you probably don't recall a lot of that. Do you remember if it was a pretty rough type town? 



CARTER JAKLE: I don't think it was any rougher than any other town. 



MRS. JAKLE: Friends of mine taught school, I used to visit up there, and they loved it there. There were lots of educated and erudite people there, because they sent so many mining engineers and lots of scientists there, you know. I assume sometime, not too late, the mining companies built a golf course and country club down there, which was beautifully run ________. I don't remember Jerome having a name as a rough mining town. 



CARTER JAKLE: I don't either. 



MRS. JAKLE: A friend of ours - a very CLOSE friend - a cousin of my uncle, in fact, was superintendent of schools there for a long time - Oscar Monde [phonetic spelling] - and they had wonderful schools. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you remember something? 



CARTER JAKLE: Nothing more. You were just talking about the canyon.... 



MRS. JAKLE: I think what I __________ about the canyon is we went and used ________ (



CARTER JAKLE: But that's later.) half a dozen times. Oh, yes. This was in the late twenties and thirties. But we always went to the canyon. When anyone ever came, we went to the Grand Canyon. That was a wonderful trip. The last few times I've gone to take my grandchildren, I have just wished, oh, how they could have seen it before it was crowded and full of people. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, I can imagine. 



CARTER JAKLE: Uh-huh. It was just a different world entirely. I suppose that's the world over, though. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, yes, it's changed a lot. Let me see, do you remember Front Street much? 



CARTER JAKLE: Oh, yeah. I remember Front Street. There was a bunch of saloons. Lots of saloons on Front Street, and some Chinese restaurants. The Commercial Hotel might have been there, too. We used to save these ball player coupons that come off packs of cigarettes, and we'd go down Front Street, with our head down, lookin' at the gutter, tryin' to (chuckles) find these tickets. I'd go with Jimmy Babbitt. We'd go down there and our mothers would really get disturbed with us. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, I was gonna say, I thought that was supposed to be… 



CARTER JAKLE: But I didn't notice any - we didn't pay any attention to the drinkin’ or the drunks, or anything like that. 



MRS. JAKLE: You were looking for baseball (several talking at once, none discernable) 



CARTER JAKLE: Yeah. We were looking for baseball pictures. (laughter) 



MRS. JAKLE: Orrin (?) told you, I guess, he said one of his greatest joys was, pastimes, was looking through the grates in the wood sidewalks, tryin' to find nickels. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, yeah! He said his father used to clean underneath 'em. Yeah. (laughs) That's neat, all the little things you did as a kid… remember. 



MRS. JAKLE: Even our children, way back in the late thirties and when they were little, were playing ball in the vacant lots all around, which is practically downtown now, you know. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Wow. Yeah. It's all built up down in there. Let me see here. What did I want to ask you about? 



MRS. JAKLE: The college has always been a wonderful thing for <Flagstaff>, because they had community events and concerts, and traveling musicians and people who would come. Being on the mainline railroad, we've always, it seemed to me, had more advantages than many towns, as far as <Flagstaff>. I always called it a little city, instead of a little town. Don't you feel that way? 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah! Oh, yeah, I do. 



MRS. JAKLE: Not provincial. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: No. Well, I suppose compared to some very, very _________. 



MRS. JAKLE: Well, it's probably MORE provincial now, than it was when it was very small. It had an air of sophistication about it, and so many of the people in <Flagstaff> had come from cities originally, and observed certain amenities. Mostly when you were invited to dinner the average people used to dress for dinner and go and have calling cards. Now, since all of the town has spread, it's more cosmopolitan but less sophisticated, I would say. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Right. Now, do you remember the Riordans __________? 



CARTER JAKLE: Oh, yeah, I knew them. The Riordans, too, they were there when we came to <Flagstaff>, and they had SOME children about my age - a couple of girls that were a little older, and then this boy, Robert, that was a little younger. Later, at the parties, they'd have parties up there, they had two houses: the M. J. Riordan house, and the T.A. Riordan house, connecting with a dance floor or a billiard room or something between the two houses. And that's where you'd have parties and dances and things like that. They did a lot of that in those days. I mean, people would have parties and they'd dance, have refreshments. I guess there wasn't too many public dances, as I recall. 



MRS. JAKLE: My first memories of going out with Carter were going up to the Riordans to a dance, or up to the George Babbitt house on a special dance or occasion. 



CARTER JAKLE: It seemed like somebody was always givin' a party. 



MRS. JAKLE: Verkamps' house that was the big one on the corner of… whatever that next street, beyond Fine and San Francisco… We went to a dance they were having at one time ____ neighbors _________. Private parties for the young people. They were always giving them. 



CARTER JAKLE: I worked up at the ALandT Company for two years, and there was all of us… but I don't remember much about it, except they had a train wreck. (



KRISTINE PRENNACE: 



CARTER JAKLE: Oh!) 



CARTER JAKLE: I remember that, because a friend of mine was workin', he was a brakeman on the train. They were out in the woods, and they had these two trains loaded with logs, and one of 'em got loose and ran into the other one, and there was logs scattered all over the place. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, my gosh! 



CARTER JAKLE: The train crew came in and quit. I mean, they got their paychecks, and this Conway boy, Johnny, went and got his camera and went back and took pictures of the wreck. But other than that, I don't remember TOO much. 



About the mill, they were doing a lot of remodeling while I was up there. Oh, I do remember another occasion that they found a dead man under a flywheel. I don't know, he’d been there a couple of days the odor is what (chuckles) [brought them?] out. I went over to take a look, but I didn't stay very long. I left right now! Found out that he was not working, he was not an employee. He'd probably gone in and got caught in a belt or something and pulled under this big flywheel. I remember that deal. 



And I remember another time when they had a robbery. They broke in the office… and I don't remember, I guess they opened the safe. The safe and vault were open, and all the money we had was in a little stand, as you came down the hall into the office, they had a little cash box there. It was my duty to put that up and lock it, and I think I forgot to put it down, and they didn't get any money! (laughs) Who'd think of the money bein' out in the… 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh! so they didn't get it when they came in and broke in? 



CARTER JAKLE: No! (laughter) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: For negligence! 



MRS. JAKLE: One of the greatest things, that when you had company, you took the people up to take the tour through the observatory. Even years ago, I remember hearing my folks talk about it before I would go. (somebody's jostling the microphone, obscuring Mrs. Jakle's comments) ________ somewhere. I don't remember what year, but they would go to <Flagstaff>, and then they got to go TO the observatory and have the tour. 



(looking at photographs) This was how untrammeled and all it looked, where they skated. I guess that's Black's Pond, I don't know. But look at that, how beautiful. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, my gosh! Was this out at Black's Pond, this picture? 



CARTER JAKLE: No. Let me see. Oh, that's… 



MRS. JAKLE: I don't know that, but that's before my day. 



CARTER JAKLE: No that’s out to… I don't remember the name of it. There's a dairy out there, southwest of <Flagstaff>. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, okay. Someone had mentioned… 



CARTER JAKLE: No, we found this place one time; the ice is wonderful. 



MRS. JAKLE: Oh, yeah, they'd go hunting. 



CARTER JAKLE: Found the ice and rounded up everybody that you could think of, and said, "We've got some good ice out…" I've forgotten the name of the place, but we'd just go out. Usually, that's the way things would happen. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: You were working with Babbitts' during the Depression. I was wondering how that affected the business. 



CARTER JAKLE: The Depression affected <Flagstaff> just like it did any town. There was no bread lines, though. But we all accepted… 



MRS. JAKLE: Took care of each other. 



CARTER JAKLE: … cuts in pay, the whole business - something I could never really understand, where one day everything was here, and the next day it wasn't. I mean, it seemed… But among other things we did in our office was keep the books for the Flagstaff Undertaker Partners. People didn't die during the Depression - they couldn't afford it! (laughs) That's a fact. You can look through the records, and when you see this Depression, there's no deaths, there's no funerals. And why, I don't know. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did people just go and bury their own people out in the woods? 



CARTER JAKLE: No, no, they just… 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: They just didn't die? 



CARTER JAKLE: They just didn't die. I guess they didn't have time (chuckles), I don't know. 



MRS. JAKLE: (inaudible) 



CARTER JAKLE: So that business suffered in the Depression. 



MRS. JAKLE: They didn't overeat, I guess. The thing I thought was interesting, that in a town like <Flagstaff> so few people - some people lost their business, and there were tragedies - but so few people were ever fired. Most people were like the Babbitts - they didn't let people off. Everybody, from the president on down, just kept taking less money, and everybody just got less. Isn't that true? 



CARTER JAKLE: Oh no. The Depression… the banks were closed as Tom Pollock, over the Arizona Central Bank, it went under. 



MRS. JAKLE: They COULD borrow money. 



CARTER JAKLE: Babbitts' almost, I'd say, went under. They were… But I don't know what ever saved 'em. They went through depressions. 



MRS. JAKLE: Well, didn't they borrow money? 



CARTER JAKLE: Well, that's what broke 'em - everybody borrowed money. And then they couldn't pay it back. Like the sheep business. They had wool in <Boston>, and they could have sold it for ninety cents a pound, and they didn't sell, they were waitin' for a dollar a pound. But they borrowed, say, seventy-five cents a pound against this wool. Well, when they sold it for a nickel a pound, somebody had to put up seventy cents on that loan, and that's what they didn't have, and they were broke. That's what broke banks. They had these loans, say, seventy-five cents, secured by wool, and the wool wasn't worth anything, and nobody could pay 'em. Well, then, what happens? So the bank goes broke. 



MRS. JAKLE: We were fortunate we didn't go through that. 



CARTER JAKLE: And that was not just that one instance, it was farmers in the valley. They had loans against their crops. And cattlemen had loans against their cattle. Well, it developed that the cattle weren't worth.... In the Depression, see, everything came down. The crop wasn't worth what they'd borrowed on it, so they didn't have anything. They couldn't pay off the loan. 



MRS. JAKLE: But, honey, we didn't see the things we heard about, like the tragedy ________________. 



CARTER JAKLE: Oh no. We had no bread lines. 



MRS. JAKLE: I don't remember seeing people standing around waiting for something to eat. We did have lots of transients. I suppose you'd call them tramps in those days. There was hardly a day that we didn't fix something for someone that knocked at the back door, going through, trying to get to the coast or someplace. I can remember one time I didn't have anything in the kitchen to give somebody who knocked. Most of them didn't ask to work, some of them would. We think our house had been marked, because we got so many. And I couldn't think what to get him, so I gave him some Jell-O. (laughs) He said, "Lady, that won't hold me!" (laughing obscures comment) I was ready [to yell at him?]. That's why I gave him Jell-O. Oh, my. We managed. I think we helped each other. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did a lot of the homesteaders lose their land around the Peaks? 



CARTER JAKLE: I don't know that. There's a lot of… Well, I wouldn't say so. 



MRS. JAKLE: The taxes weren't that high. _______ reason homesteaders weren't paying _________ everything else __________. 



CARTER JAKLE: No. 



MRS. JAKLE: _______________. 



CARTER JAKLE: It appeared to me that bean farmers kept their land. The Michelbach’s, they kept their place on the mountain. I don't remember __________. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah. In other parts of the country, a lot ____________. 



MRS. JAKLE: I don't think they did there. I think __________. Really was a wonderful place. Everybody you've found, I imagine has said how wonderful <Flagstaff> was, what a nice place to live, what a nice place to raise their children. My children loved it. They were VERY unhappy when we sold our home last summer. We kept it for six years, because they wanted us to, but it was getting run down and it needed attention. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Where was that? Where did you live? 



MRS. JAKLE: On the corner of Elm and San Francisco. It's a big white house. It was up on the hill forty-five years ago, you know. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: You were right by the [Paulens?] then? Or no, they were on Agassiz. 



MRS. JAKLE: No, we were up there on this… right across from Southern Union Gas. 



CARTER JAKLE: Charlie Dryden across the street. 



MRS. JAKLE: Got lots of windows around ___________. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, I know where that is. 



MRS. JAKLE: When we moved there, the street ended two blocks further on, a block beyond his family's home, so we were just up on there like _________ Pinecrest, where the doctors office is and Southern Union, there were no houses, vacant lots around there. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What are your children's names? I didn't get those down. 



CARTER JAKLE: Daughter Patricia Ann O'Keefe. You've got that? 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah. 



CARTER JAKLE: William Austin Jakle lives in <Houston>. Patty lives in <Mountain View California>. And Mary Kowalski, K O W A L S K I, if you can spell that! lives in Mesa. We have nine grandchildren, and one great-grandchild. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, my gosh! 



CARTER JAKLE: Why don’t you show them? We just happen to have a picture of our great-granddaughter! (laughter) 



My first school was the Catholic school - the first school I attended. It was a frame building. It housed the first, second, third, and fourth grades. And then the sisters had a brick building behind that, and they had the other grades, seventh and eighth, and the fifth and sixth. Later on, then, they moved that frame building off the property onto the corner, and it's now a residence, a house. It's still there, it's that health food place. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: That was the school? 



CARTER JAKLE: That was where I first went to school. Then the priest, Father Favre built this [Caldwell?] and the schoolrooms, which was later torn down. We went to school there. In fact, they made us help build THAT school - all the boys had to collect all the trash and clean up and things like that. Of course you'd get a little time off from classes. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: (chuckles) Which I'm sure you didn't mind too much! 



CARTER JAKLE: No.
