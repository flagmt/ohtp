This is an interview with Mr. Melvin McCormick, who has lived in and around <Flagstaff> since he was born in 1902, residing primarily in the old Sunnyside or East <Flagstaff> area. The interview is being conducted on June 9, 1976, in the McCormicks' home at 2106 East Second Avenue in <Flagstaff>. The interviewer is Kristine Prennace representing the Flagstaff City-Coconino County Public Library. [Mrs. McCormick, although not introduced or named, is also present and makes a few comments. (Tr.)] 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: All right, Mr. McCormick, can we start off by you telling me when and where were you born? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: I was born at <Maine Arizona>, out here twenty miles west, December 13, 1902. (aside about noise interfering with recording) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: When was the year? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: In 1902. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Who were your parents? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: George McCormick was my father, and Caroline McCormick was my mother. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was her maiden name? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: King, Caroline King; up in <Utah>. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: She came from <Utah>? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Uh-huh, [Gananamine?], <Utah>. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: And where did your father come from? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: <Middletown Ohio>. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Hmm, Midwestern. Now, what did he do? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Oh, he done a little bit of everything. He done quite a bit of mining and contract logging, and ranching, raised cattle, stuff like that. He worked at a little bit of everything. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: He had cattle out at <Maine>? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: No, at <Bellemont>, out there on the other side of <Bellemont>, out in Branigan Park, was where his headquarters ranch was. And then at that time, you could run cattle on that ANYWHERE - just run cattle all over the country, with everybody else. Everybody would pool a wagon and gather their cattle. All the people that had little herds would go in, and they'd all get together and run around every year here and bring all their cattle in, and then ship 'em on the railroad. They shipped from <Bellemont>. That was the main shipping point. Of course, they shipped from the closest place. They didn't have a place at <Maine> to ship from, they shipped from <Bellemont>. But they gathered there, and dad was the one of the wheels, uh, they always brought their cattle there to his ranch. And then they tallied 'em up, you know, and got a figure on who owned what, how many cattle and all that, and then sold them all to one buyer. I got quite a bit of experience punching cows when I was pretty young. (laughs) 



And then my dad, attempted to drive those deer from the North Rim of the <Grand Canyon> to the South Rim. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was that with Jack Fuss? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Yeah, Jack Fuss was on the drive. Oh, there was a lot of people on it. There were several conflicting circumstances that caused him to fail. The main one was a storm, a terrific storm. And then they run out of money. Couldn't get any cooperation from… He had a lot of money promised him, but he couldn't get any cooperation out of the Forest Service or the Indian Service. He got 300 Indians over there, and had to pay them fifteen days in advance, $1,500 dollars. And then there was more than Indians, too. And if he could have held off for three or four days 'til that storm broke, why, he'd have had it made, 'cause he was drivin' the deer. They had the deer ahead of 'em, when that storm hit. And boy, I'll tell ya', I went in there with the last load of supplies, and I had to ride on the running board of the truck and scrape the ice off of the windshield. The windshield wipers wouldn't take care of it. And it was a brand new truck, too. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What year was that? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: It was about 1920, '22, somethin' [like that]. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: And what was the purpose in driving the… They were driving them down toward <Flagstaff>, is that the direction? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Yeah, there was an overpopulation of deer on the Kaibab Forest, and they wanted to thin that herd out. They was gonna Winchester 'em. A bunch of people got together and put a stop to THAT. Dad knew that he could drive 'em, he'd seen it done before. So he got after it to drive it, to drive those deer. He sold the moving picture rights to make moving pictures of it. And the moving picture taker was satisfied with what they had. They didn't have very much - they only got to drive two days out there, before that storm hit. But then soon that they got in with the storm and all that, and deer, too. I seen a deer jump plumb over a man's head and him on a horse! A big ol' buck come over his head. That's how bad them deer wanted to turn back. And they was TURNIN' back, too, they wasn't gonna hold 'em. They'd run over them Indians. Them Indians run along with a cowbell, ringin' it. Them deer would run right by them Indians, to get back, get their tail into that storm. Dad was tryin' to drive 'em right head-on into that storm. And man, it was blowin' it so doggone hard, you couldn't see for from here to that telephone wire; that was the MAIN reason. AND, he tried to get the Indian Service to let him go ahead and keep those Indians there. They had an Indian representative over there. He wasn't on Dad's payroll or anything like that, he was just representin' the Indians. But he wouldn't ________, let 'em hole up there until that storm blew over, and then go ahead and drive the deer, because he had to start the deer off into that canyon before he got any money on the drive. The minute those deer broke over and headed down in that canyon, why, the Indians started, you could collect so much on each deer. But he had to swim 'em across that river down there, which was no trick. I've seen deer swim that river on their own. What the devil they wanted over on THIS side of that river, I don't know. There wasn't nothin' to eat over on THIS side. Them wild burros kept it all ate off. Dad went in there and Winchestered all those burros, in order to get feed on this side of the river. Spent all winter in there, killin' burros. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: When he was mining, where did he mine? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Oh, he had several mines. He had one down at Hackberry that he sold and then bought his cattle outfit with that. And then he had a mine in the bottom of <Grand Canyon>. Grand Canyon National Park Service took it away from him, after they made a park out of it. He was in there, though, before it was a park, and had that mine. He sure got a raw deal on that, 'cause he'd spent, oh, $100,000, I guess, in there, developin' that property. And they just kicked him out. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What activities did your mom have at this time? Just maybe staying at home? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Oh, she belonged to several clubs around. Rebeccas was the name of one. I think the Rebeccas - that's the female Odd Fellows. (laughter) I'm pretty sure that she belonged to them. 



I used to sell pocket knives, and I'd go out to these logging camps and sell them to the Swedes, and it was all Swedes then doing the logging. I'd sell those knives, and Mother, she had me order some knives for all the members of the Rebecca Lodge. They was a novelty, cutlery knives, with a picture on the handle. And she got all the pictures of all the members, and sent 'em in and had 'em put on those handles, a picture of the party that owned the knife - had their own picture on the knife. 



MRS. McCORMICK: She took care of old, sick people? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Oh, yeah, she was a midwife. Not only midwifing, she took care of… Well, when people had pneumonia here, Dr. Raymond would turn them over to Mother, if they got so serious that he figured he couldn't do no more, why, he'd turn 'em over to Mother and she'd cure 'em up. She had __________ onion poultice - onion and sugar. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Mixed it together? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Uh-huh, mixed it together and put it on their chest and their back. And she'd just stay with it until she broke that abscess, and then it was all right. She used to take ME with her all the time. I had to make those onion poultices and keep 'em hot. Clean up the rags and stuff like that, to keep… ______________ once got started, it took a lot of onions to do it. Once we got started, why then I’d keep addin' to it. The stuff wore out, _______ break those abscesses. She saved a lot of people around <Flagstaff>. So did Mrs. Corbett. ____ Corbett was logging foreman for Babbitts. Mrs. Corbett took down pneumonia and Dr. Raymond give give her up, turn her over to Mother, and Mother cured her. So Corbett come to town and this is all happening about eleven, twelve o'clock at night, and he went down to Babbitts' Store and got the night watchman and got a sack of onions and a sack of sugar, and he got well prepared. And Mother cured her, and broke that abscess that night. 



Then one of the Lockett girls that still lives here, I think - I haven't seen her for years - she was just a baby, and they called Mother to come and see her. When Mother and I walked in the front door, this baby, you could hear it breathin'. And boy, I'm tellin' you, the breathin' was BAD, HARD. And Mother walked over to the fireplace and took a shovel full of coals out and dumped a bunch of pepper on it and held it tight between that baby. That baby got to sneezin' and broke that abscess. That girl still lives here in <Flagstaff>. I forget what her name was. I think it's Pauline. 



They used to be very active in square dancing. Working at the light company. I can't remember his name. I know him real well, and I know Pauline real well. Of course, we grew up together. I eventually would know. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you have any brothers or sisters? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: I've got one brother and one sister, and then I've got two half-brothers and one half-sister. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Where did you have most of your schooling? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Emerson. The only schooling I ever had I got (laughs) at Emerson. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Who were some of your teachers that you had? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Oh, Mrs. Lines [Linney?] and then I can't remember. 



MRS. McCORMICK: (inaudible whispered comment) 



MELVIN McCORMICK: What’s the name of the man who’s head of the Wool Growers Association. His wife ______ teacher. 



MRS. McCORMICK: Lura Kinsey. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Lura Kinsey was one of my teachers. She beat my butt with a rubber hose. (laughter) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What for?! (laughs) 



MELVIN McCORMICK: I don't know! Oh, I do too. We had a fellah we called "Boots." He wore cowboy boots to school all the time. His name was Dickinson. He had his foot back like that, you know, with his boot on, and I had a little can of gasoline, in a squirt can, and I squirted it on his boot right there and then set it afire. (laughter) Boy, he come out of there, that boot got hot on him, and it went to sleep. He was asleep on his desk. Boy, that boot got hot, and man, he come out of it and he hopped out into the hall and took that boot off. Laura Kinsey beat my butt for it! (laughs) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: I can see why he was a little upset. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Oh, yeah. I wasn't any angel by any means. Most of these old-timers will tell you THAT. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any other schoolmates particularly, or any stories? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Paul LaRue was one of my schoolmates. I went to school with Andy Devine here in <Flagstaff>. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was he like as a kid? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Oh, he was kind of backwards, but he was funny all the time. He was always cownin’. He was a good guy, no trouble involved. Got along good with everybody. He played football with us, basketball, and stuff like that - baseball. We used to have a lot of fun at it, too. (aside about passing something) 



MRS. McCORMICK: (inaudible) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, tell me the story… she's asking me to have you tell about when you put a little wagon on the school… Halloween. (laughter) 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Al Beasley lived right east of Emerson School, just across the river. He bought this… he had a little buggy with rubber tires on it, you know. So Halloween night, he had it in his shed, and he had the [shafts?] tied to the roof, to the ceiling of this barn that he had the buggy in. Us kids went and stole that buggy out of that barn, and we took it over there in the school and took it all apart, and took it up on the roof and put it back together. (laughs) The next morning, why, boy everybody broke out with what cameras they had, takin' pictures of that buggy on top of that school. But truant officer, a fellah by the name of Jackson, I believe they was just a-raisin' Cain, tryin' to get his buggy down, off of that roof. Jackson (?) said, "Why don't you go to the guys that put it up there, and pay 'em to take it down?" So he said, hell, he didn't know who put it up there. He didn't have to go [and me?]. (laughs) I know who the rest of 'em was. (laughs) Al Beasley come to me, he said he'd give us five dollars apiece if we'd take that buggy down off that roof. I told him, "Mr. Beasley, that's gonna be thirty-five dollars." He said, "I'll pay it." We took the buggy back down and took it and put it back in his shop, and he give us thirty-five dollars; seven of us. He give us thirty-five dollars, and that was a pile about that high along about that time. Man, I'm telling you, we had a ball with that five dollars apiece. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Can you think of any other things that you did? 



MRS. McCORMICK: (inaudible) 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Took a burro in the school, and he was shod. We could pick the lock and get into the school. And we took this burro in there. We stole a bale of hay - we stole that off of Al Beasley. (laughs) Then we tied this burro's tail to the bell rope, and then put that broke up bale of hay open and put it just where that burro couldn't hardly reach it. He had to ring that bell, that big ol' heavy bell. That burro got to ringin' that bell. Of course us kids all left then. That burro ______ on that hardwood floor and get a bite of that hay, and he'd pull the bell out there, and then the bell would come down and it would pull him back on the floor. And he rang that bell for about two hours! (laughter) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was Al Beasley like, that you guys were always (laughs) doing this to him? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: ________. Well, there wasn't nothin' much else to do. We had to supply our own entertainment. There was nothin' else to do, and we had to dream up something to do. In other words, dream up some mischief to get into. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was Al Beasley a nice guy, or did you do things like this, like take his hay and put the buggy up, because you didn't like him as kids? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Oh, no! he was a nice guy. He just had that nice buggy, too. (laughs) Brand, spankin' new; boy. We took it apart real nice, took all the wheels off from it, and took the body off of it, and took it up on that school building. Hoisted it up there with a rope, and then put it all right back together, and tied the shafts up in the air, so it looked real nice. On top of that school building! (laughter) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What kind of daily chores did you have to do, or work that you had to do, like, when you were school age? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Well, most of the time I worked at the school because I assisted the janitor. Then I had to milk cows, take care of the barn. My dad was loggin' and had eight head of horses in the barn. I had to clean that barn out and feed them horses every day, on top of the work at the school. 



MRS. McCORMICK: (inaudible) 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Yeah, and then there was milk. She sold milk. Had two cows, two and three, four cows. Sometimes I had to milk as many as four cows. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you haul the milk to a camp? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: No, just delivered milk around town. 



MRS. McCORMICK: Oh, I thought you ___________. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Oh, now, that was out at the ranch. When we was at the ranch, why, Mother made cheese. She was milking about, oh, from sixteen to twenty-five head of cows, and she didn't have anything to do with the milk, only made cheese out of it, and butter. She would sell the butter and cheese to the Saginaw-Manistee Lumber Company. They was buyin' it for their cookhouses and stuff. They had several camps, and they bought all their cheese and butter and buttermilk - I used to sell buttermilk to them Swedes. I'd take my wagon and haul it around in the woods and deliver it, with that thing. _________ would always give me something . And they would have if I'd have charged 'em for it! (laughs) _________ pretty ______ on that. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Where were you living at the time that you were going to school? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Out there where Cheshire Motors is now. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Cheshire Motors? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Yeah, what do they call that now? It's right there just before you turn in under the underpass, on the right-hand side there's… 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: That tire place? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Yeah, and they have a little International stuff, truck, _______ on that corner. When Dad sold the ranch, he had a big old lodging house there. Part of it was apartments, and then part of it was rooms, just single rooms. Mother run that for years. Then Dad went loggin' all the time. He logged at Riordan, he was loggin' at Riordan during WWI. And I learned to drive loggin' trucks for him right there (?) before he got killed. _____________. Dad ______ never let me load and unload. But I got smart one day and ____ the blocks out, and those logs started rollin' and they caught me between the ground and the logs, and it just mashed me into the bark that was under… Dad had to dig bark out, to pull me out from under those logs. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: But you were okay, you weren't hurt? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Yeah, I wasn't hurt at all - just scaret to death. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: You were awfully young then - what, twelve, thirteen years old? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: I was about twelve, thirteen. I was just a kid, [half?] grown kid. I loved _________. But I doubt it _____ twelve, thirteen would be about right. And I drove __________. I drove those ________. I could drive six-up when I was fourteen years old. There was no trick to it a-tall. Dad could drive, he used to drive those twenty-mule teams. And freightin’ I don't know where. I know that he logged here for Riordans with bulls. That was before he met Mother, though. See, he came to <Arizona>, when he was here in <Flagstaff>, and went up into <Utah>. He met Mother up there. She was a widow woman and had a dairy, and Dad went to work for her, milking cows _________. He was breakin' horses for some of my uncles up there, Mother's brother. I remember he never liked those people up there, Mother's relatives. They sold out, they sold that dairy, and come to <Arizona>. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What were expectations of your parents towards you as kids - like your behavior in school or… 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Oh, they left it up to the teachers and the principal to keep us kids in line. R.H. Richardson was the principal one time, one of the principals. He had a system for keepin' you in line - a big ol' strap with a lot of holes punched in it. (laughs) Cut down the wind resistance! 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: I take it you've had experience with that strap! (laughs) 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Oh, yeah. I run from him one time, and he could outrun any kid in that school. And I run from him, and I started to jump the fence, and I shoved one foot through the top railing of that fence, and right there is where he caught me. He was runnin' behind me and caught me by the back of the neck and ____________ (comment obscured by laughing). He proceeded to polish it off right there. (laughs) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: About when was it that your family moved to <Flagstaff>? I don't have that quite straight. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: They come in here in 1908, they moved from <Maine>, from Brannegan (?) Park. Then, of course, we lived here in the wintertime, and then out to the ranch in the summertime. Us kids went to school, me and my brother. Then when my sister got old enough, she went to school up here too. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: So is that 1908? When did you get married? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Which time?. (laughter) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: The first. (laughs)

[END TAPE 1, SIDE 1; BEGIN TAPE 1, SIDE 2] 



MELVIN McCORMICK: …hauling from the post office out to those different… We'd take full loads to the trading post, and build up a full load here in the post office and we’d haul it out onto that reservation. Then we went to work for an oil outfit out there, haulin' water. They was wildcattin' for oil, out there… Kayenta (?). We worked there for them for about three years. Then I still maintained a truck and hauled around here. My brother and my dad and I was in together on those trucks when we was haulin' out on the reservation. We kinda split up after that oil outfit. Mother had the trucks, and I kept what I considered MY truck - it was an old GMC truck. I kept it. We still owed mother some money on it. Mother loaned us the money to buy that truck. We still owed her. ________ give his truck back to Mother for what he owed her on it. So Dad just throwed his in, too, and he went to loggin' again. So I wound up finally, by takin' all three of the trucks again, and then I sold two of 'em and just kept the one. And then when I went over to <California>, I sold that one. I’d paid it out clear. So I just sold it back when I was over there. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What year were the trucks? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: They was about 1912, '13. (phone rings, tape turned off and on) I watched a fire right up here behind the block pen (?) on Christmas Eve. Burned up the house and burned all the kids' toys - they had a big family - _____ bicycles you could see them burning. And I decided to do something about it, so I dug into this volunteer fire department business. There wasn't very much known about it. I went down to <Phoenix>, down to <Glendale> where they had a volunteer fire department down there, and I found out a lot about it. Then I went over… I think, over by Mesa, and never did make it, but in <Mesa> they had another volunteer fire department there. I found out what the procedure was, and the board of supervisors was cooperating with us every way they could. But they had certain rules and regulations to follow, and the county attorney - I won't mention who he was, 'cause he's still a lawyer in <Flagstaff> - HE wasn't cooperative at all. We had to put the metes(?) and bounds of the fire district in our application for the volunteer fire department. And we didn't get those metes and bounds all in there, and the board of supervisors couldn't accept it until they WERE in. Well, I carried those petitions three times all by myself, and got fifty-one percent of the signers on 'em three times. And then my wife and Mrs. Maumentz [phonetic spelling], they helped me on the fourth time. That fourth time we had it right, so we got the fire department started. We built a firehouse; we just had the one truck. But we had a lot of volunteers. We had a good fire department, too. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Where was it built? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: It was built over here on the corner - the FIRST fire house. There's a Checker Auto Parts… 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh-huh, on Santa Fe and Fourth? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Yeah, they built it behind… Allan Day [phonetic spelling] was the fire chief, and he owned a big piece of property there. We [bought the cinder blocks?] from there, and [Bertram?] put up a cinder block building just big enough to hold the one truck, and a stove in it, to keep it from freezing, 'cause there was a lot of little lines on that high-pressure pump that we had to keep from freezing, had to keep it inside, 'cause we just had the one truck. Of course, before we was through, why, we had three trucks and a water truck. And when we went into the City, we turned that over to the City. 



MRS. McCORMICK: (inaudible) 



MELVIN McCORMICK: There we are with our youngest granddaughter. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, cute! 



MRS. McCORMICK: (inaudible) 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Oh, a little potatoes. (tape turned off and on) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: When was the first building for the volunteer fire department built? Do you know what year that was? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: No. About 1936, somewhere around there. And then we finally got this place. Al Beasley dedicated a park down there. And we got him to sign on a paper saying that his granddaughter, Kathleen… Keller, she had to sign the papers. He willed all that stuff over to her. They give us enough ground to put the fire hall on it that they're usin' now. Of course we got our alarm system and all that worked out over a period of years. I think it's only six percent, is the most they can tax on a fire department, all of your fire department. It may be more now, I don't know. Maximum of six percent per annum is all you can tax for the fire department. So we had to go on that _________. Can't put a volunteer fire department in debt. They can't go into debt. So we had to buy our trucks on a lease-purchase plan. We leased the trucks from _________ and then when it was paid out, they automatically… it was our property. That's the way we bought our trucks. We bought a little ol' Chevy, the first one. It had a lot of hose on it and a thousand gallons of water. It was so overloaded that when we got it out in the wintertime, we had to really DO somethin'. Took a long time to get to the fire. But we worked on it, __________ and we practiced and we never had any fire plugs. I think we had fire plugs, three, to put in, to install, but there was no main water lines, until a long time later. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: There wasn't any? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: No, there was just a two-inch line out here from town. And then they put in a six-inch line. I don't know who done that - I think Al Beasley and Alf Dickinson. Finally had to put it out here, they sold so much property out here, that they had to run that six-inch line out here. And they run that six-inch line out here, then that's when we got our first fireplug. Put it down there ______ motel right on the corner down there, the corner of Arrowhead Drive and Highway 66. That's where we put our first fire plug, out in there. We had our second fire plug went in there behind General Tire, in the alley there. That's the only place __________. They run that six-inch line in there. I think it ended there. After the place started growin', they put in… Most of that was all volunteer work on the development of this community. 



They didn't have any electricity out here. My dad moved a house out here and he lived over there. And I bought a piece of property down there and built a house on it. We were usin' gasoline lanterns. We worked out a deal with the light company, and we furnished all the poles and dug the holes. Everybody in East Flag was supposed to dig holes and pay for a pole. We never got any money out of a lot of 'em, and they wouldn't dig the holes, mainly because it was solid sandstone rock in most places. Had to shoot those holes. My dad and I was about the only ones that could handle powder, so we shot those holes, and they was supposed to pay us for that. Some of 'em paid us, some of 'em didn't. Then when the power company had to pay all that money back, they had to give it back to the customers, according to law, they give it back to the people that was supposed to dig those holes. (laughs) They were just that much money ahead. (chuckles) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: When was this, that the electricity finally got to East Flag? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Oh, I don't know, about??? (inaudible) Well June (?) was just a baby then. When was she born? 



MRS. McCORMICK: She was born in ‘31. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: It was in '31 then, when we got the first power out there. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Tell me about the development of this area, this part of <Flagstaff>. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Well, it was developed in several plots. The first old original Sunnyside was from Main Street over to Fourth Street. And then back up to about First Street here, or Second Avenue. There was… Bonner had a yard a truck yard right in here, where ICX is now. He bought that property from Beasley and built that truck yard out of it. Then they got up to Sunnyside, a number two, I think they called it. What’s these lots here? Sunnyside somethin'. Anyway, that was the second development - they extended it out. Now, Al Beasley bought all this old Johnson property, from fellah by the name of Johnson had it. There used to be an old green house down there, a bootleg joint, for years. Al Beasley and Alf Dickinson bought it together, and then they decided to subdivide it. They rented that old green house out to some Greeks, and those Greeks run that bootleg joint there for a long time. Of course, they got wrapped up every once in a while, too, but that didn't keep 'em from bootleggin'. (chuckles) 



And then Sunnyside Farms was this old Isabelle property over here, run plumb back up to Sixth Street. Herb Babbitt _____ and George Babbitt. 



MRS. McCORMICK: This here was Sunnyside Farms, from here on out. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Yeah, Sunnyside Farms. 



MRS. McCORMICK: This is Sunnyside. Sunnyside Farms is the next. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Well, Sunnyside Farms was across the street. 



MRS. McCORMICK: And this is Sunnyside. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Sunnyside and Lester went to Sixth Street, too. And I know ________ I done moved this house IN here. There wasn't anything, only down there. This house was one of the first houses in here, in this area. 



MRS. McCORMICK: This is ____________. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Well, yeah. That little house over there, I moved IT in there before Emmett (?) bought that. He bought that, and I forgot who he bought it from now. 



MRS. McCORMICK: It was really [cute?]. He met a few people up here, _____________. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Yeah, and that's 4th Street. 



MRS. McCORMICK: _________ probably 1960 (?). 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What KIND of people then settled in this area? It wasn't the established families then, was it? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: It wasn't what? 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: It wasn't like the established families that had lived here for a really long time? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Oh, yeah, there was a lot of old-timers: Fred Paul, he moved out here. I forget what that old man's name was that lived down here for years and years. He moved out from <Flagstaff>. It was mostly people that… 



MRS. McCORMICK: Fluffy? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: No. We rented a place from here when we lived _____, rented a house from him. He had an old Model "T" truck, and he wouldn't drive it only about ten miles an hour. That's all _________. We rented from HIM, and then we rented from - Butler built a couple of houses up ________ for his kids. ____________. The kids decided they didn't want to live there, so they put those houses up for rent and I rented one of 'em, and lived in it for about four years. In fact, that's where I started the fire department, is from there. Of course I… (tape turned off and on) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: So, Lane was Fourth Street? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Uh-huh, it was dirt. I think we lived up there about four years, I rented that property from Butler. Lon Butler lived up there for a long time, after they quit the sawmill - Lon and Clarence, Clarence Butler. I think the old man built that house that we rented - for Clarence to live in. I think they moved the sawmill somewhere. Of course they didn't want to drive, so they built houses at the sawmill, and they moved out, and they had the house for rent, so I rented it. It was about 1930 (?) about twenty dollars a month is all the rent we had to pay for it then. But that was pretty good money then, too. We felt the rent was too high (laughs), naturally. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What did most of the people who lived out here, do? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: They was all working-class people. They worked around at different jobs. There was mechanics and welders and a little bit of everything. I had trucks. I had livestock trucks and dump trucks. I opened up the first sandpit up there where the [Bleeks?] is gettin' their sand up there. I opened that up, and then I give it to the city. (tape turned off and on)… places. They worked at mills, sawmills. There was two sawmills here then, and they worked at those. A lot of 'em worked at the sawmill. And then most of 'em, a lot of 'em had businesses of their own, like garage repairmen and stuff like that. They had garages in town. There was a young mechanic - I forgot what his name was - that had the back end of Walhouse's (?) garage, leased, and was repairing automobiles, and he lived out here for a long time. He belonged to the fire department. [Rue?] Butler worked for the County, and he lived out here for years. He belonged to the fire department too. Ben Davis, he worked for the State. He lives right over here, and HE belonged to the fire department. 



Pat Hogan blamed me ____. There was thirteen of us quit the fire department all at one time. They was gonna let us run our own fire department, and then the minute they got us annexed into the city, well, they started tellin' us how to run the fire department, and what we COULD do and what we COULDN'T do. And I wasn't very active then. I was haulin' livestock and I was away most of the time. So Ben Davis and Rue Butler decided on this quittin' the fire department. So they come and asked me if I'd quit WITH 'em. I said, "Sure, I'm tired of fightin' fires anyway." So I just quit too. I got all the blame for it, because I'd been, you know, more or less runnin' the fire department. That's the reason I got the blame. Pat Hogan, he didn't want me on there because he knew I wouldn't take any of that guff off of the city council: I'd tell 'em what I thought about it, and that'd be IT. But Pat Hogan, he wasn't that way. The city council was gonna tell him how to run that fire department, just "yes, sir; yes, sir," and that was it. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you get paid as a volunteer fireman? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Yes, but about all it paid is for cleanin' our clothes. I think $3.50 a fire. It wouldn't pay for the clothes we burnt up. We was always burnin' clothes. The last fire I remember they had, some people left, and they left their house. And that fire must have smoldered all night until about two o'clock in the afternoon. A cigarette had started it, in a davenport. It finally broke out into flames and started smokin', and somebody called the fire department. That was the last fire that I was on. I don't think they had any more. 



Thirteen of us quit. They quit just because they was tryin' to tell us how to run this thing out here, and we didn't feel like they knew how to run THIS end of it. They knew how to run the CITY end of it - that was in there. But we didn't have any equipment. We had to depend on our high-pressure system to put it out, and we never lost but one house. And THAT thing was falling in before they ever called the fire department. That was another case where there was nobody home. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were there any stores out in this area at that time? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Chapman started one. Happy Chapman built his right down here where that Honda Motorcycle [sic] place is. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was it fairly recent? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Wait a minute… 



MRS. McCORMICK: ______ and Joe. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Tom and Joe started that. 



MRS. McCORMICK: ___________. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: And Mrs. Johnson, yeah. Martin Johnson's wife started a store over here. And then Tommy and Joe put a store in where that hardware store is out on the corner of 66 and Fourth Street. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Why did they develop THAT area, over on Fourth Street, with stores? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Well, it was mainly the Greenlaw property, and it was vacant property, and close to, onto 66, and they started developin' it, and it just grew right out of that - all that area opened up, mostly on 66. That 66 was all opened up, way on out, to where DJ's Bar is out there now. They had stores and repair shops. A lot of them, Wally Mulnit (?) had a repair shop out there; garage. 



MRS. McCORMICK: (inaudible) 



MELVIN McCORMICK: No grocery stores. Tommy and Joe was the only ones that had a grocery store. They had a grocery store down there, and a meat market. And boy, they done good, too! 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: But if you wanted anything, mostly you had to go back into the main part of town? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Oh, yeah. We done a lot of tradin' in town, but we done a lot of tradin' with Tommy and Joe, too. 



MRS. McCORMICK: They had no meat. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: They had a meat market in there later, though. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: So your kids had to go to school in West Flag, then? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: I think they started out here. Yeah, I KNOW I started Zena (?) out here. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: No, Zena (?) had to go to that _______ school, ____________________. ______ school. And she still had to go in there until second grade __________ school. She had to go in town, she was at the Marshall School, and then _______ was lost, they went to open house, everything ________. That was before Honey was born. __________ 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: They had to go into Marshall School? 



MRS. McCORMICK: One. The other one started here __________. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: When was this area annexed onto the city? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Oh, God, I don't know. _____________. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: It was after you were here? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Oh, yeah. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: _____________ in the late fifties, maybe? 



MRS. McCORMICK: Could have been in the early sixties. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, it could have been? 



MRS. McCORMICK: It could have been, I don't remember. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: But it was THAT recent? 



MRS. McCORMICK: Oh, yeah. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Oh, yeah. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, I had heard, and I don't know if this is true or not, that when a lot of the migrations were happening, you know, from, like <Oklahoma> to <California> during the Depression years, did a lot of people stop off here and settle in this area, in this end of town? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Well that was more or less true. There was quite a number of Okies settled in here. But, still the predominant residents of Sunnyside was still local people. 



MRS. McCORMICK: (inaudible) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh-huh. 



MRS. McCORMICK: (inaudible) 



MELVIN McCORMICK: People wanted to get out of <Flagstaff>. That was the reason I moved out here - I wanted to get out of <Flagstaff>. (someone enters, tape turned off and on) There wasn't too many Okies who moved in here. I hired one, Judd Shelton [phonetic spelling], and he worked for me for a LONG time - seven years - when I was in the house-moving business, moving houses from Jerome up here. 



MRS. McCORMICK: (inaudible) 



MELVIN McCORMICK: He was an Okie. 



MRS. McCORMICK: Davises were Okies. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Yeah, but they were more or less natives. They'd been here for years and years and years - all of 'em. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did people used to camp out in this area before moving on down Highway 66? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: No. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: No, they didn't? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: They had a little spring up here on, oh, let's see, about where that Circle "K" mart is up there. Now, people used to go up THERE and camp. I'd tell 'em about it, or somebody'd tell 'em about that spring, and they'd go there and camp at the spring. There was quite a few people camped around that spring. It didn't run very much water, AND it WOULD go dry. As long as it run water, they kept it dug out good and camp there. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were there any churches out in this area? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: No. I guess we sold property to the first church. 



MRS. McCORMICK: No, I don’t think so. I think that was _____. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: There wasn't any churches in 1950, out in this area? 



MRS. McCORMICK: No. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: No, I don't think so. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: You were basically out in the country then, it sounds like. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Oh, yeah! I used to pick potatoes here for Ben Johnson. He raised potatoes all over this, and I picked potatoes for him at ten cents a sack. I made pretty good money at it! 



MRS. McCORMICK: (inaudible) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: How was it out here when it snowed? Did you have any kind of snow removal at all? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Just what the County done for us. The County accepted this main street as a county road. And then I got the whole Sunnyside system put into the County, as County roads. And then the County took care of the snow removal. They didn't do too good a job of it when they first started, but then they got down to where they DID do a pretty good job of it. And it was ROUGH. There was a lot of people that had to shovel their cars out and stuff like that. Of course, we lived up there on the highway… 



[END TAPE 1, SIDE 2; BEGIN TAPE 2, SIDE 1] 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Of course after we got the Fire Department, why then they did a pretty good job takin' care of it and gettin' us to wherever there was a bunch of houses, and the houses were scattered out. There was a bunch of houses up on Arrowhead Drive, and they took good care of that, and they cindered the streets, and I really would say that the County done a good job for the amount that they had to come off of taxes out here. They done a GOOD job of takin' care of East <Flagstaff>. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, now we can talk about some of the historical events that affected you and <Flagstaff>, such as the world wars. Do you remember World War I? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: I was in it. I never got overseas. I got in just as soon as they opened it up for volunteers - I volunteered. I was only seventeen years old and I lied about my age and got in the Army. And then when Harding reduced the Army, I got out. I’d had all of it I wanted by then. I got out and come home. Right after that is when we started our truck company. My brother bought a truck that was a second-hand truck. Hennessey's [phonetic spelling], the shoe company, had it. And it was solid rubber, there was no lights on it. We started in haulin' potatoes with it. 



MRS. McCORMICK: (inaudible) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: How did World War I affect <Flagstaff>? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Well, it took all the men out of it, all the YOUNG men out of it. You couldn't hire any help. I worked for the Forest Service and I worked for my dad, and I was only fifteen, sixteen years old, on account of all the young men was gone to war, and they couldn't get 'em. I rode fire line between here and Barney Pasture, horseback - stayed out at Rogers Lake. Then I worked as a lookout on Woody Mountain; worked as a lookout on Mount Elden. (phone rings, tape turned off and on) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did World War II affect <Flagstaff> very much? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Yeah. More, I'd say, ____. There was more people here then. It didn't affect it like it did in World War I. In World War I, it took ALL the young men out. The draft got 'em all. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: But it wasn't quite so devastating during World War II? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: No. No, for the simple reason that there was more people here, and they took 'em out slower. You didn't notice it so much. And then the exemptions was greater. In World War I, they didn't allow any exemptions hardly a'tall. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What about Prohibition? Do you remember much about that? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Yeah. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Tell me, for the record. (laughs) I can tell the way, she's laughing. (laughs) 



MELVIN McCORMICK: There was lots of whiskey somewhere around here - bootleg. Some of it was good and some of it wasn't so good. They made whiskey all over the country. I mean, I knew almost every still that was in operation around. (chuckles) We made whiskey out at <Grand Canyon> and I hauled it in, in that old truck. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: (laughs) That was part of your freight, huh? Did you ever get caught by anyone? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: No. No, I got close two or three times. 



MRS. McCORMICK: He watched the guys who made it ________________ and then when they left, they went and _______. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: I'd go steal it. I stole most of my whiskey. I bootlegged for years out there, and I stole most of my whiskey. Them guys would come up, they was makin' it down on <Oak Creek> and down in that country there - had a lot of fruit down there, and nothin' to do with it. They had no place, no market for it, so they just made whiskey with it, and they'd bring that up here, and it was good whiskey, all of it. And I got to trailin' 'em. Boy, I was a good tracker, I'll tell you! A guy pulled off of that road, he'd better not leave any tracks, 'cause I'd follow him and find out what he was doin' out there. And then I'd steal it and take it off somewhere else and cache it. And then I'd bottle it up and peddle it. Generally when I found it, it was in kegs. 



MRS. McCORMICK: Be careful ______. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: (inaudible) 



MELVIN McCORMICK: There ain’t nothing they can do about it now. (laughter) 



MRS. McCORMICK: We found - this was about, oh, ten, fifteen years ago, we was out on a picnic, out by the lake… By what lake? Oh, up there on the road to <Grand Canyon>. And we was hunting for a cave. They used to have an [outlaw hill?]. Peg Leg had his stake up there. And boy, we was all happy, somebody found the cave, and we got in and by golly, there was an old still in there! (laughter) 



MELVIN McCORMICK: They STOLE the still one time, _________. They brought it in and put it back in the City garage. A fellah come to me and he said, Melvin, can you get [in] that City garage? And I said, "Hell, yes, that's easy." He said, "Will you go in there and open the door for us?" I said, "Sure." So I went upstairs and slid down the fire pole, and went from the fire hall right into the garage and opened up the back door. They took two gallons of whiskey and the still. They had it for evidence. And that's all they had, was just two gallons of whiskey. They busted the rest of it up, and brought the still and two gallons of whiskey to town. (chuckles) They had to turn the moonshiners loose, 'cause they didn't have any evidence! (laughter) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you say there was someone down the street a ways that was bootlegging? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Yeah, that old green house. There used to be a big green house right down there, where Whiting has got their service station and motel. A big two-story green house, and they bootlegged out of that thing for years. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Right on the main road?! 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Right on the main street, right over here. It was all dirt then. But they run that bootleg joint. I used to know what them Greeks name was but I've forgotten it now. I've forgotten their name. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: How did the Depression affect you and the area? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Oh, it hit me just as hard as it did anybody else. I had trucks. Well, when I come back from <California>, I quit over there because they wanted to cut my pay, and I'd worked for 'em for nine years. I wouldn't take the cut. I figured I could draw seventy-five cents an hour anywhere I wanted to go, because I had a good reputation as a worker and a truck driver. I come back to <Flagstaff> and I could have signed up. If I'd have signed up for Babbitts' for five years, why, they'd have put me on. But I wouldn't sign up with NOBODY for five years at that time. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: That was during the Depression and Babbitts' was hiring? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Yeah. But they made you sign up for five years. 



MRS. McCORMICK: ___________. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: No, driving truck around town here. They had an old Pierce-Arrow truck, and they was wantin' a driver for it, and I'd drive it until they found somebody that would sign up for five years, and then they'd put 'em on and turn me loose, because I wouldn't sign up for five years. I drove it and then Victor (?) Bartlett drove it, and he signed up. His dad was working for Babbitts'. And I worked for Babbitts' off and on, different jobs. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you just kind of have to find whatever job you could at that time? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Oh, yeah. We got them there at the Babbitts' Store, they had an icehouse in there, and that ice would _____ spring a leak, and ammonia was leakin' out. They got me and Fred Haufman [phonetic spelling] to go in there and fix that leak. Boy, I'll tell you, we had a hell of a ____________. The fumes were so strong that you couldn't stay in there only a little while. It'd make you sick to your stomach and you'd have to come out. Soon as you got your breath again, and quit vomittin', we went back in and we finally got the leak all stopped. We sure had trouble doin' it. 



MRS. McCORMICK: You killed a lot of rabbits ________. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Oh, yeah. I killed rabbits and sold 'em to Clyde Sukey [phonetic spelling]. He had the Back Cat (?) cafe. He paid me fifty cents a rabbit for those rabbits. And that's the only way I could make any money for a long time - all one winter. We just barely… We had lots of beans and lots of potatoes. My brother had a truck, and I still had that old GMC and we had a deal, and we'd haul beans and potatoes for people. But they didn't have any money, so we'd have to take beans and potatoes for pay. So we had lots of beans and lots of potatoes, but no coffee, no meat, no nothin' like that. We had trouble gettin' bacon to season them beans with! (laughter) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, I bet! What other ethnic groups settled out in this area? When did the Mexican-Americans come in and settle? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: There wasn't too many Mexicans settled out here - just a few. And they was good people, all of 'em. I knew all of 'em, and associated with 'em. They was good Mexicans, good families. Took care of their kids and all that stuff. They wasn't any old "Mexican Mexicans." They was all… MOSTLY of 'em, was residents of <Flagstaff>, and they just moved out here to beat taxes and stuff like that. And then it was easier to get property out here than it was in town - lots. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did most of 'em work at the mill then? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Lots of 'em did, yes. Lots of 'em did. Lots of 'em worked for Babbitts in different capacities in grocery stores and stuff like that. Babbitts' hired a lot of people. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: There weren't any black families out here? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: No. I can't remember of ANY colored people out here at all. 



MRS. McCORMICK: (inaudible) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: That was in the 1950s, and they were probably the first black family? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Yeah. We were _________ colored _________. 



MRS. McCORMICK: (inaudible) 



MELVIN McCORMICK: _________ somewhere up there. 



MRS. McCORMICK: (inaudible) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: There weren't many Oriental families, were there, at this time? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: No, there weren't any. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: No one out in this area. There were a few in town then, weren't there? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Oh, yeah. There was quite a few Chinamen in there. I don't know about Japs or anything like that, but I guess Chinamen. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: When did tourism start to pick up in <Flagstaff>? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Oh, the tourist trade's been good ever since I can remember it. I can remember back when we used to have to go from here to <Grand Canyon> in horse and buggy. It was a heck of a trip to go out there in one day. We'd camp out either goin' or comin'. Dad had a reputation for gettin' a lot out of livestock. I know his sisters come out here from the East and they took a buckboard and they went all the way to the canyon in one day, by goin' up through Kendrick Park and that way, goin' straight in. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, now, they went like the 180 route? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Uh-huh. They went up. Then they camped coming back. The horses was tired (?) and they come halfway and camped, and then come on the next day. 



MRS. McCORMICK: The people, the tourists, ___ always stopped here in <Flagstaff>. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Well, they went through on the train and went out on the train to <Grand Canyon>. But the ones that stopped here, they had taxi service. Bucco Sisk and Bill Conley had taxis here, and they used to haul 'em out. But they went around by <Williams>. Well, at first, the road went INTO <Grand Canyon> went out through Dead Man's Flat - dirt road all the way. And then they built that road in from <Williams>. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Taxi service? You mean they actually used cars to take them out? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Uh-huh, they'd rent their taxis and they'd take 'em out there. I drove taxis here for Clyde Crozier [phonetic spelling] and hauled LOTS of tourists out there, as a matter of fact. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: ________________? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Stay out there for a couple of days. They'd stay there at the El Tovar Hotel. I'd stay there at the hotel, too. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Which hotel? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: El Tovar. 



MRS. McCORMICK: Up at the canyon, El Tovar. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Fred Harvey had it. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Is that the same one as like the Harvey House at <Ash Fork>? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Yeah, the same hotel's still there. They've added onto it and added onto it. It's got to be a great big hotel now. But they just had the old building there, then. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: I can't think of any other specific things to ask you. Do you have any other stories or anything you'd like to… 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Well, I knew Captain Hance that used to be out there at the <Grand Canyon>. (laughs) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh! okay, tell me about him. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: He was the damnedest liar that ever come down the road! Those stories he'd tell the tourists, boy, curl your hair! One was about his wife, but he never was married, he never had a wife that I knew of. He said his wife wore gumboots out there, and he told her not to wear them gumboots out there. She fell over the cliff and she just bounced and bounced and bounced and he had to shoot her to keep her from starvin' to death. (laughter) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: He liked to tell stories, huh? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Oh, Fred Harvey PAID him to lie to them tourists. He just set around there in the El Tovar Hotel and told them tourists the damnedest lies you ever heard of! (laughs) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: He was one of the main attractions! (laughs) 



MRS. McCORMICK: They used to have for fun, a Saturday night dance out here, somewhere. But they went out and it always wound up in a big fight, you know. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: The Saturday night dances? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Oh, yeah. Out at Twin Peaks. Well out there at Doney Park was the schoolhouse, at Doney Park. They used to have a Saturday night dance there almost EVERY Saturday night. And hell, if there wasn't three or four fights, the dance wasn't a success! (laughter) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What other kind of social activities did (laughs) you have on this end of town? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Oh that’s about all - huntin' and fishin' and stuff like that. We used to hunt all the time, and there was lots of game. Huntin' was good. 



MRS. McCORMICK: That’s social? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: I don't know whether you'd call it a social activity or not. We'd go out and camp out. We used to hunt squirrels down in Barney Pasture. We'd go down there and camp for three or four days, hunt squirrels. There was two women here, named Maxine. Her husband run the theater. Sam Switzer built that Arrowhead motor. He had a garage there, and then a service station. And Mrs. Maxby [phonetic spelling] and Sam Switzer's was makin' fur coats with the squirrel hides. __________ haulin’ out on the reservation. I'd buy hides from those Indians - fox and coyote and bobcat. They'd just keep 'em and they would tan 'em up. They tanned 'em up theirselves. When they got enough of 'em to make a coat, why, they'd make a fur coat. They were doin' good with it. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, Sam's wife… was he a brother of Bill? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: No, relation ____ all together. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, a different spelling. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: They spelt the name the same. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, they spelled it, it didn’t have an E in it. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: S-W-I-T-Z-E-R, Switzer, just the same as Bill Switzer. Frank Finnley built that building where Switzer's Store is, that second-hand store there. Used to advertise all the time. I lost the road out there the other side of <Red Lake> (laughing) one time. Driving at night, and I got off the road, and I got to lookin' for the road in the dark, and I couldn't find it. Finally, I camped, I got tired of roamin' around in them bushes up there, the sagebrush. I camped, and the next morning I seen some writin' on a rock. They moved the road away from that rock. I walked about a mile-and-a-half over there to read that _______. “All the wise <Flagstaff> folks rest their heads in Finnley’s fourteen dollar beds”. (laughter) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: I think I read in a book somewhere that you've been on - I'm not sure it was YOU, but it was a Melvin McCormick that found a date carved on a rock, with a cross that the Spanish had… 



MRS. McCORMICK: Oh, yeah, I've got a picture of that. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Got a picture. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Where was that? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: It was out on the <Little Colorado River>. It hung together with a story of __________ loads of silver that's buried out in that country somewhere, I say around Sunset Crater. I’ve never been able to find it. I’ve hunted and hunted and hunted for it. But I think it was Lee Durham, she claims to have found a bar of that silver. They had it that fine hotel laying in the window. My dad tried to tell Alf Dickinson that it wasn't lead, it was soft, you could bend it; pure silver. Dad took his knife and took a little sliver off of it, and he told Alf, he said, "That's not lead. Too HARD for lead. It's silver." 



MRS. McCORMICK: (inaudible) 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Yeah. Dad knew from the color of it, too, that it wasn't lead. And finally some chemist come along and cut a little sliver of it off and tested it, and told 'em it was pure silver. Well, they went out there and dug that whole country up, lookin' for some more of it. But those priests was fighting the Indians, and they evidently lost that bar of silver and a sheepherder found it. He was a camp __________, he wasn't a sheepherder, he was just a camp ________. They worked two people together with the danged sheep. One that done the cookin' and prepared the camp and took care of the burros and all that stuff. He was camped right there, and he found this bar of silver and he give it to, I don't know, either it was Lou or Jack, one of the Diamonds. He brought it in and give it to him, and Jack Diamond give it to Al Beasley and… what was Dickinson's name? Alf Dickinson. Alf Dickinson was running the Pine Hotel, and he just laid it there and thought it was a bar of lead. It was about that long, and about four inches square. 



MRS. McCORMICK: (inaudible) 



MELVIN McCORMICK: I just barely could pick it up, and I was just a kid. I could just barely pick it up. But Lou - either Lou or Jack, whichever one it was – took dad out there and showed him the exact tree where this Mexican found that bar of silver. Then Dad picked up the story and got it from a nurse and a doctor that came here lookin' for this silver. And old Ben Doney had been with 'em for a long time, and they had maps and everything, that this priest had got away. The two of 'em got away. One of 'em died down on the river, and this priest made a notation in his record that Father so-and-so had died and he buried him and marked the grave. And Doc Kittredge found the grave, and found markings on the rock. So we went out there and took pictures of it, Toni Richardson and I went out there and took pictures of it. We've got pictures of it _________. (inaudible) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: (inaudible) 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Soapstone. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Soapstone it’s up the river… <Cameron>. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: It's up the river from <Cameron>, about fifteen miles up the river from <Cameron>. 



MRS. McCORMICK: (inaudible) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Can you think of anything else that you'd like to _______? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: No, I think that pretty well covers it. A LOT of it, you could go on for hours. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Sure. You might want to describe the downtown area to me, when you were growin' up. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Well, there wasn't a whole lot IN that downtown area. There was a lot of vacant property around _________. The City Hall was a large store, was right there next to the City Hall - they tore that all down, now. The Commercial Hotel, the Weatherford Hotel. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: You mentioned the Pine Hotel earlier. Was that a fairly nice place? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: No, it was a honky tonk all the way through, too. Never was a NICE hotel - the Commercial and the Weatherford was a nice hotel. And then they built the Monte Vista. My half-brother named the Monte Vista Lone Savage. They give a prize for the best name, and Lon and his wife come up with the Monte Vista and won that prize. I think it was twenty-five dollars or something like that. It was built by a bunch of people, and the Nackards was mixed in it, and Sliphers and different people. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you know when the Nackards came? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Well, the Nackards came here - I went to school with Fred Nackard. They'd been here for years and years and years. I don’t remember… 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was Fred born here? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: I think the whole BUNCH was born here. I knew all the Nackards and all the Chinamen - the Wongs. They had a laundry over across there. Old Man Wong told me one time, "Never do anything in a hurry. You always get yourself in trouble, doing things in a hurry." And boy, he was sure right. He was a pretty wise old Chinaman! (laughter) Wong June’s dad. They've got that system of namin' people fouled up. ___________. I don't know how they worked it, Wong June. The Wong part they hang onto but the June part is the same as, same as our first name. They put their Wong part ahead of the June part. One of 'em is Wong June's brother, Leamon June. I don't know, they changed it all around. Leamon - Wong Leamon, I think was the way they put it. And then he put the June part. He was a brother to Wong June. Wong June had the Rose Tree. I think they all took that June part later. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you know when the Zanzucchis came to town? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Zanzucchis, they haven't been here too long. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: They haven't? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: No. 



[END TAPE II, SIDE 1; BEGIN TAPE II, SIDE 2] 



MELVIN McCORMICK: The clerk that filled the order and initialed that ticket. As you come into Babbitts' Store, I was in there. (laughs) "Whose signature is this?!" Showed ______. They finally showed him - this guy ________. "Listen, you little son of a bitch, what do you think I wanted to do, pickle that old stud horse of mine?!" (laughter) I mean she'd get up in Babbitts' office and she'd - Pat Moran [phonetic spelling] runnin' Babbitts' store, was the manager. And boy, she'd get on old Pat Moran and you cold hear it all over this end of town. She'd sure tell him off! 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: And their main business was land? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Yeah, they had cattle and then they owned a lot of property around town, they had a lot of rentals, and stuff like that. But their main business was cattle. 



MRS. McCORMICK: Heiser. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Yeah. Johnny Heiser had cattle all over this country. 



MRS. McCORMICK: And there was always Pete Michelbach. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: The Michelbach family, yeah. They was all over. Old Pete Michelbach, old Peg Leg held him up. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, did he really? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Yeah, he tried to talk old Peg Leg out of it. And they (?) knew Peg Leg. Old Peg Leg had been out at his ranch and ate with him and stuff like that. Told him, "Hell, I'm just a poor old Dutchman with a big family. I can't afford to lose these groceries." Peg Leg told him, "You'll be a dead Dutchman and all them kids will be orphans [if] you don't hand them groceries over." He took all of Pete's groceries, took off with 'em. That Peg Leg, he was somethin'. I remember me and my brother, ½ brother, my brother-in-law Luke O ‘ Brian won a watch at a rodeo here in Flag. And had a hundred ________, and he left it in a trunk out there at the ranch, and old Peg Leg broke into the ranch and he got that watch. He went through everything in the house. He must have stayed there two or three days, in the middle of the winter. We ran across him out there one day, and we stopped and talked to him. Of course he had that old shotgun - he had an old sawed-off shotgun trained on us all the time we was talkin' to him, and we just [asked him], "What time is it, Peg Leg?" Peg Leg says, "You don't want to know what time it is, you just want to know if I got your watch, and I've got it." (laughs) It had Luke's name on it. They'd engraved his name on it. Had that twenty-four carat gold plate, gold watch. ____________. Luke was afraid to wear it. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: So he got away with that, huh? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Yeah, Peg Leg got away with that. 



MRS. McCORMICK: __________________. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Pete Michelbach claims he knows where that cave is. That cave's up there. Barney Kilman [phonetic spelling] knew where it was. Barney was gonna take me TO it, and I was gonna take a metal detector and run it around in there and see if I could find his cache, 'cause old Peg Leg told Luke about [that guy?]. He said, "They'll find my cache one of these days, and it's worthwhile." 'Cause he robbed every ranch in this country, and took anything of any value out - silver and stuff like that - and ran off with all of it. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Would he go after the ranches in the winter when most people were in town? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Yeah. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: That was when he would come? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Yeah. Well, whenever he could catch 'em away from their ranch, he used to go in and steal groceries from 'em, if they just went off during the day. He'd go in and take all their groceries, put it on his back and pack it. He was a big husky guy. He was that wide. The only thing wrong with him, he had that leg off just above the knee. They shot him out there, almost killed him out to Wild Bill Tank, right up above <Bellemont>, about seven miles up there; that trail. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Had he hurt anyone? Had he ever killed anyone? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: No. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Just scared 'em? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Yeah, he did that. You’d be lookin' down that old shotgun loaded with horseshoe slugs and brother, I tell you it made a believer out of you right quick-like. But it was sawed off. The barrel on it wasn't that long. When he had it trained on Luke and I, the sun was shining. Down in that barrel, you can see them horseshoe slugs he had it loaded with. Hell, if you ever tripped that thing, it'd have blowed you apart. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any other characters in the area that you can describe? You did a good job (laughs) ______________. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Old Bucco Sisk used to stutter. Boy! the stories they tell on him! He was a comical son of a gun. He was workin' over there in the garage. He had a fight with somebody and got after him with a crank. He was tellin' me about it. He said, "Boy, you oughtta seen the hole that sssson of a bitch left in that, and was there when he seen that ccccrank." (laughs) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Who was that? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Bucco Sisk was his name. 



MRS. McCORMICK: He was a taxi driver. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Tourists pulled up there and they had their stand out there at the Commercial Hotel. A tourist pulled up there one day and said, "Have you got a post office in this town?" Bucco said, "Dddid have, but we sssold it." (laughter) He was always doin' somethin' like that. Boy, he did a bang-up business in that taxi. These tourists would go back East and they'd recommend him, all the way through. (laughter) They'd send people back here, and they'd come here lookin' for Bucco. And then somebody called him, told him to meet the train, brother was comin' in on the train. Bucco went down to the depot, this guy got off at the depot, and he stuttered just as bad as old Bucco. Old Bucco wouldn't even answer him, he just turned around and went and got in his taxi and went on up to the hotel. This guy walked up to the hotel and got him a room. Somebody asked Bucco, "Why the hell didn't you let him know who you was?!" "Dddid you thththink I wwwanted to get my dddamned block knocked off?!" (laughter) Both of 'em stuttered, see, and Bucco wouldn't even answer him. He just turned around and walked off. 



MRS. McCORMICK: Two women whose husbands were (?)bricklayers when they fought? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Yeah. 



MRS. McCORMICK: (inaudible)

And they used to fight all the time, ________, over the brick - who made the best brick. They was havin' a fight. They lived right…Milligan lived right across from Emerson School. And they was havin' a big fight there one day when I was coming from school. This other woman said to Mrs. Milligan said, "Your husband's brick is not as good as my husband's brick. It is more red, but not so hard." (laughter) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you know George Hochderffer? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Hochderffer? Yeah. I knew all of the Hochderffers. 



MRS. McCORMICK: Hochderffers, yes ______. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: We bought that house from them. They lived in that other little house for a long time. I think he built that OTHER house. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Is that Junior or Senior? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Senior. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, he lived over in this area? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Yeah. They come from down around <Maine> and down in that country, a whole bunch of 'em, all the Hochderffers. They raised cattle, _________ Platnum. Old Man Platnum - did you ever hear him holler "Gee!" all over in this country? Only had the one boy. He was an ornery son of a gun, and he was always doin' somethin'. You know, the old man was always hollerin' at him. _________ a lot of times. __________ roundups. Gee and I was about the same age, ___________. Holler, "Gee! Gee! Son of a bitch!" He'd cuss him out! I think his favorite pastime was cussin' Gee out. (laughter) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Can you think of anything else? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: No. 



MRS. McCORMICK: (inaudible) 



MELVIN McCORMICK: I remember when… 



MRS. McCORMICK: (inaudible) 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Old wagon road went down in <Oak Creek>, down in there. Boy, that was a booger. They used to haul apples from ___________ to <Flagstaff> and sell 'em, paddle ‘em around all over town, a box here and a box there, five pounds or ten pounds or whatever you wanted to buy. Apples, peaches, all that stuff come from <Oak Creek>. Cucumbers and all that; vegetables like that. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was that one particular family? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: No. There was, well… What the hell was that old man's name? Used to be constable here for years. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was it Francis? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Uh-uh. No. I can't remember right now, but he had a place down there. We used to come up here and stay at own place and peddle apples and stuff like that. We'd bring a whole load of 'em - bring four head of horses and two wagons. _______ two wagons out of <Oak Creek>, hooked together with a rig(?). He made it, some way. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Rough road. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Yeah. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was that the road we go down now, down the switchbacks? Or was it Schnebly Hill? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: No, it was… They had Schnebly Hill first. And then they built the road out of <Oak Creek>, pretty much… worked on that a lot. They built that road up. You can still see part of it. None of it was where the road is now. Well, it started in at the same place, and that's about all. But as you go down in there, if you look back across, you'll see where they've walled up with rock. And the first one of the trucks, there was an old [Kissel?] truck went off in there, and the fellah just left it there. Well, we went and took it out, my brother and I. Took the motor in it, rear end, front end, and left the bed there and the bed’s still there. If you look real close, you can see it. We took everything we could grab out of it and we put it back together. My brother went over to <Los Angeles> and bought an old truck. It wasn't worth a cryin' dime - just barely got it home. But we put that Kissel motor in that truck that he bought, and then we put the rear end in it - same rear end that we took out. We put the whole thing in - we put the front end on that truck, the rear end on it, and put the motor and the transmission. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: The man who lost the truck wasn't hurt? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: No. Boy, he just figured the truck wasn't worth takin' out of there. 



MRS. McCORMICK: Did he jump out? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Yeah, he jumped out. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: He jumped out on its way over. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Yeah, he was goin' down in; he was goin' after a load of fruit. 



MRS. McCORMICK: But as you can see, that old ___________. I mean, today, ______________. 



MELVIN McCORMICK: _________ truck. _______ switchbacks. You come around 'em, and then you had to back up to make your turn. You couldn't just switch on around, the turns were too sharp. You couldn't make 'em with a touring car, let alone a truck. A truck would have to back up two or three times. _______ truck ________. 



I drove a truck out in on that dugway into <Lee's Ferry>. I drove a [Coleman?] _________. _____ four-wheel drive truck down in there. They sent that truckload from <Los Angeles> with a boat on it. That guy got to that dugway, he wouldn't take it down in there. And my dad was standin' there, and I was drivin' truck for the County, an old Model "T," one-ton Model "T." I hauled supplies out there to 'em; and that ferry would run out. We drowned two carloads of _____ scotch, ____________, in that river. (thumps table) Ferryboat broke the cable. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: That was up at <Lee's Ferry>? 



MELVIN McCORMICK: Uh-huh. That's where the County had Dad and a fellah by the name of [Lamboard?] out there, takin' that cable out, pullin' that cable out of the river. It was buried in the quicksand and they couldn't get it loose. They had to, in order to break it loose, they had a big old rope block and tackle. They'd pull that rope out there, just as far as they could go, and then tie it. That stretch on that rope got to shakin' that cable loose, pullin' that cable out of that quicksand. They had a continuous strain on it, and that's the way they got that cable out of there. Took 'em about two weeks to get the cable loose. Then they stretched it back across that river. It had extra cable. Where the cable broke was on the other side of the river, and right up at the clamps, where it was clamped on. And on THIS side of the river they had a lot of extra cable. I forget how long that cable was, but if they could get it out of that quicksand, they come and asked Dad if he thought he could get it out, and he said yes. 



So they sent him out there with four head of horses to pull that cable out, to get the cable out. And Dad had this - it was a big ol' rope block and tackle. It had about an inch-and-a-quarter rope in it, maybe an inch-and-a-half. ______ out there, and what they call a [bib?], a big ol' chunk of wood down with a log, buried down under the ground with chain around it. And then they hooked this block and tackle onto that and onto this cable. And then they'd pull a strain on that cable and tie it. Put all the strain they figured that rope would stand. 



[Longport?] wanted to give up on that. He was the County engineer. The old man said, "No, I come all the way out here to get that cable out, I'm gonna get it out." So he went to work with this block and tackle, and Longport give him three days, but at the end of three days, Dad had had so much success with it, that Longport could see that he was gonna get it out, if they let him go long enough. It was better to wait for him two weeks __________ than to have to buy a new cable. Get that ferry back in there. So Dad took it out. Finally got it up. 



I had this Model "T" down in there. This guy come out there at the head of the dugway, and he unloaded his truck, started down the dugway, and he got down there and got scared, and he quit it, and he walked on down. The people that was at the head of that expedition that was gonna go up that river, they was there at the Ferry. They'd come out in a car, and this truck got in the next day. They was camped down there, and they come down there. They come and asked me if I'd drive that truck on down. I went and looked at the truck, and I told 'em yeah, I'd take it down in. The worst it could do is ____ rip that _______. I told 'em I wouldn't guarantee the truck. So I pulled it down in there. They just had the boat on it. But they'd unloaded about five-ton of supplies up on top. And I put it down in there four times. And then that guy that was drivin' the truck decided that HE'D try it. So he put it down in there three or four times, but he forgot. I told him when his wheels were up on the bank, and he finally put the truck off in the river - lost the truck, went over. 



MRS. McCORMICK: We're getting way off of where we started. The lady wanted to know about <Flagstaff>. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh that’s okay. Okay, I think that's probably…
