This is an interview with Miss Olive McNerney, who has lived in <Flagstaff> since 1922, and taught for many years at the Flagstaff High School. The interview is being conducted on June 18, 1976, at Miss McNerney's home at 710 North Leroux in <Flagstaff>, by Kristine Prennace representing the Flagstaff City-Coconino County Public Library. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Miss McNerney, when and where were you born? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: <Carthage Missouri>, August 28, 1893. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Who were your parents? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Martin A. and Margaret Warner McNerney. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Where did they come from originally? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: <Lock Haven Pennsylvania>. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What did they do, what type of a job? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Well, my father was general manager of the Carthage Quarry Company. My mother didn't work. She had her hands full with six children. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: (laughs) Okay. You had brothers and sisters, six of 'em right? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: There were six of us. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Where did you have your early schooling? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: From the first grade through graduation in the Carthage Public Schools, <Carthage Missouri>. That's where I was born. [Interviewer's note: Not recorded, but mentioned after interview, was the fact that she went to college at Cornell University.] 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Born and raised right there in the same town. Let me see, when did you come to <Flagstaff>? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: In 1922, September first. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: And why did you come? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: I had a job in the high school here, teaching Latin and Spanish - Latin and German it was, that year. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, let's discuss your job then in the schools, and some of the people you knew. It was the high school? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Yes. But when I came, the town only had 3,000 people, and there were just two schools: the old Emerson School, that was torn down before this other one was built, and a three-room school that was held in the old Catholic Church for the Mexicans. That was pre-primary, primary, and first grade, which got them started on their English, you see. And then all the other grades, kindergarten, clear through, my first year here was the first year we had the eleventh grade in the high school. Up until then, it'd just been a two-year high school. And when you finished the tenth grade, if you wanted to go on to school, you went over to the college, and they had a more or less high school division over there that they would take them. So when I came here, they put in the tenth grade that year, and the high school that was torn down about three years ago - oh, I guess longer than that, four or five years ago - was being built then. So in '23, we moved into that. We stayed there 'til '55. And the year we moved into THAT, we put in the senior year and had our first graduating class then in '24. And Helen [Runke] Harnisch, Mrs. Ed Harnisch, and Tommy Knoles, Sr. are still only two of the class I know of still living in <Flagstaff>. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: They were in your classes? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: They were in that first graduating class. We had thirteen seniors, and they were two of the thirteen. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Goodness! Now, you spoke about the Mexican American school for the children. Was that called the Brannen School? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Yes. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember where that was located? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Yes, it's over there. I can't tell you the exact street, but you turn down - you go past the station and then turn on that first [street], and turn down at the first crossroad, and I think you turn again before you come to it. It's quite a ways down in the old town. Originally, it was the first Catholic church built in <Flagstaff>. That's what it was. Brannen, the man, was a doctor, and they were one of the early settlers here. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you know Dr. Brannen? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Oh, no, he was gone long before my time. There were none of the families. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: None of the family was left. 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Not here, when I came. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: They came VERY early. Now, where was the old high school located? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: When I first came? 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh-huh. 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Down where the Emerson School stands today. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, right. Okay, they held the high school there. 



OLIVE McNERNEY: That was the only other school in town, except the Mexican one - [all there?]. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: And then they built ANOTHER high school, didn't they? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Yes. That was torn down five or six years ago. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. 



OLIVE McNERNEY: We moved out in '55, and then that became the junior high, but it was connected with our high school. It was a bad idea, there was too much running back and forth. But then this one was built, and then that one was built about… and in '55 we moved over here. I can't tell you the exact date when that one was - the new one, was built over there. It hasn't been more than four or five years, I'm sure. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: It's fairly recent. 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Very recent. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: So how many children did you teach the first few years you were here? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Oh, I couldn't tell you. I can give you a better idea about telling what happened when we got over to the NEW building. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. 



OLIVE McNERNEY: In '23, when we moved into the high school, we had seventy-eight children, beginning with the eighth grade and ending with the seniors. Now, you can figure that not ALL of the seventy-eight took languages. None of the eighth graders did. It was one of the largest classes in school. So all the classes were small, of course. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was there much interest in languages? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Yes. Of course at that time it was just accepted more or less that you took them, unless you had something else in mind especially. We didn't have TOO many courses to offer. (laughter) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Who were some of the other teachers that you taught with at first? Well, in those first few years. 



OLIVE McNERNEY: I think I'd better get my annual to tell you that, to be sure. (tape turned off and on) That's the original view of the high school when it was first built; no trees, nothing. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Nothing, just bare out there. 



OLIVE McNERNEY: With all eleven grades crowded into - and the kindergarten - crowded into one building, we were lost in the new building. (laughter) That's J.Q. Thomas. He was both principal and superintendent then. He had been here one year when I came, and he retired in '46. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was he real strict and a good disciplinarian? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Yes, he was. The teachers liked him. He got along well with his teachers. For some reason or other, the children were afraid of him. I never knew him but once to bawl out a student. But they had more respect for their elders in those days. 



Well, to begin with, Doris Badley taught art. Selma Aas, music. Edna Dotson, English. [H.W.] Denman, shop and coach. Helena Dolfin, seventh grade. Lester Fleck, eighth grade and mathematics. J.P. McVey was mathematics. Grace Sandon was commerce. Myrtle Webber, domestic science - home economics, they call it now. And [J.W.] Sitler was science. The school board members, do you want them? 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Sure. 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Dr. V.M. Slipher, C.B. Wilson, and G.T. Herrington. None of them are living now. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did Herrington have a daughter that originally taught? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Had two daughters: Betty taught here, became Betty Irish later on; and Helen. V.M. Slipher had a daughter in the [Sunmonex?] School here. And C.B. Wilson had two sons that went to school here: Charles - you probably know him, he's a lawyer here in town. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: I've heard of him. 



OLIVE McNERNEY: And Jimmy, who died not long ago. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any of these people well enough to kind of describe to me? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: I'd be afraid to tackle that. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, okay. That's fine. 



OLIVE McNERNEY: I'll give you this, and you can sort of make up your description yourself. I was looking to see if there were any more seniors here. Agnes Switzer is still in town. I'd forgotten about her. She's Agnes Anderson. I told you Tommy Knoles, Helen Runke. (pause) I think those are the only ones still here. You can look at 'em and see what you think of 'em. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, sure, I'll get the spellings of the names. That's really nice. How were the classes run at that time? Do you remember class size that you might have had, __________? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Oh! mine were very small. The first year at Emerson, I think my largest one was about thirteen. They were all small. The old auditorium at that building had been made into three classrooms, and all the classrooms, as you can imagine, were jammed, so one of my classes I taught down in the engine room. (Prennace laughs) And one in the library. (laughter) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: The engine room? Would that stoke fires then to keep the building warm? It was wood fire? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Wood furnace. Well, it used coal, I guess. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: The custodian had to keep stoking the fire then? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Uh-huh. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did the children have many extracurricular activities that you can remember? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Well, of course they had athletics: basketball, football, and baseball. I told you Denman was the boys' coach. I was the girls' basketball coach. The court was outdoors. There was no gymnasium or anything. The court was outdoors, and we weren’t on the basketball court once between the first game and the last game. We had to do our practicing in the halls. (Prennance laughs) I don't need to tell you, we didn't win a game. (laughter) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: After school hours were over? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Uh-huh. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: And you'd practice in the halls. Who did you play, just against each other? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: No, we played Williams and Holbrook and <Winslow>, and the college. The college played high school games THEN. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: (laughs) Goodness! Maybe we can talk some about <Flagstaff> now. Do you remember what the downtown area was like when you first came? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Well, no, because most of 'em are gone. There are very few buildings - the Babbitt building was there, but that's the only one that I think that I remember in THAT section. I don't know, the building down there where Fronske's Studio, that one was there. And there was another bank on the opposite corner to the Babbitt Store. There were two banks: First National Bank was in that one over there on San Francisco and Aspen. And the other bank was on the other corner. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any theaters? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: There was only one, that was the Orpheum, and Miss Castigan managed. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember what types of shows were there? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: They didn't have any shows then, they just had movies. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: I had heard at one time that there was a couple that used to come and play the piano and the violin or something. Did you ever go to any of those? (no audible response) Just to the movies. 



OLIVE McNERNEY: That must have been before my time. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: It could have been, very well could have been. 



OLIVE McNERNEY: I know that theater roof caved in, in '16, but that was before my time. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Before you got here, uh-huh, right. Was there a library in town when you came? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: No. School library, which was small. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was there a full-time librarian at school? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: No. One of the teachers had it. They didn't have a full-time librarian until, oh, I guess in the forties. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any of the hospitals? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Yes, the hospital was in that house over there. Is it still there? It was next to the mill office - the old mill that was torn down. The hospital was on the corner, and then right next to that - and I don't know whether it's still there or not, was the hospital. The mill ran it, really. It was a mill hospital, and very small. It was the only one they had until this one was built. Sechrist built this one up here. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What were the neighborhood areas, the residential areas like then? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Well, they were very small. The street, Leroux, ran up this hill and stopped. Of course where it comes up, it was a dead end. There were no houses on this side of Leroux, beyond this [rock?], and only two on the other side. Beaver stopped up there where - didn't stop really - it didn't go on up the hill, but it turned and went out on the Fort Valley Road. It curved around an old barn, the old Campbell barn. And all those other streets stopped down there at Elm. They didn't come through at all. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: So it was just Beaver and Leroux that came through as far as Columbus? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Right through. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Have you always lived in this home? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: No, I've lived fifty-two years here. I lived down in the old Hennessy place on Park Street, my first year. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Is that still standing? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: I think it's been made into two apartments now, but it's still there. And in the Beard house over on Beaver, 600 block on Beaver, my second year. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: And then you moved in here. 



OLIVE McNERNEY: In here. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Who were some of your neighbors then? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Well, Lura Kinsey. The town knows her. She taught at Emerson for years and was principal of Marshall School over here. She resigned shortly before she died. And then Dr. and Mrs. Mackey had the house next to us. And his son, who was born in that house, and his wife live there now. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh! It stayed in the family all these years. 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Same family. There aren't any others on this street that were living here when I moved up. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any artists or famous people that came to town occasionally? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: No. There was one, but I don't remember his name. I'll tell you who COULD tell you, if you call her, is Mrs. Herbert Babbitt, Josephine Babbitt. In fact, I think she has one of his pictures. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was that [Louis] Akin? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Yeah. That's the one, now you won't need to call her. I couldn't think of it. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you ever meet him, or you just remember him coming to town? (no audible response) What was the social life of the community like? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Well, hard to answer. There wasn't any really definite social life. Every family had its own friends and dinners and things like that, but the town was too small. There weren't any class distinctions, except between the Mexicans and the white ones then. The Mexicans all lived south of the track. The place was rather small, there weren't any lines drawn or anything. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any churches particularly well? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: There were only three when I came: the Catholic, which was in over back of where the school is, that Catholic school is now, the old church. And the Federated, which was Methodist and Presbyterian. And the Episcopal. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Where was the Episcopal? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Where it is now, right on the corner of Elm and Beaver, that rock church, pretty church. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh-huh, yes, I remember it. 



OLIVE McNERNEY: The next church to come was the Baptists. That didn't come 'til in the thirties, I don't think. I think it came in the thirties. It was a [chapa?] car, down on the railroad track. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any weddings? Did you attend any? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: No. I guess I didn't pay much attention to them, 'cause I don't remember them. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: That's okay. Do you remember any kind of political activity in <Flagstaff>, the city officials or city government? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: I couldn't tell you who.... I may be wrong about this, but I don't think <Flagstaff> was a city. I think it was an unorganized town when I came. Of course it had a mayor and things like that. But if I remember correctly, it was several years after I got here before it took on the status of a city. I may be wrong about that, but that's my memory. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: ________. Do you remember any of the people who were in charge of the government? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: No, I don't. Have you got that copy of the paper they put out not long ago that told? That should tell some of it. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah. I just wondered if you had any personal memories of anyone here. Do you remember any kind of communication between <Flagstaff> and <Phoenix> or the rest of <Arizona>? Or was <Flagstaff> primarily isolated from the rest of the state? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Oh, it was isolated to this extent: My first trip to <Phoenix> by car was in '26, and we left here at eight in the morning and got in there at five in the afternoon. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, my goodness! 



OLIVE McNERNEY: But Lura Kinsey, who was born in <Flagstaff> in 1890, remembers making it in a wagon - with horses and wagon - and it took them two weeks to get there. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: You never took the train? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Oh, yes, I've taken the train. It left here at eleven, and got down there in the morning. It was just a short trip after the train came in. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Which route did the train take then? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: The tracks are still over there. It went to Williams and turned down, I think it was just this side of Williams. I don't believe the trains run anymore, except special. I think they run special passenger trains in there sometimes. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: It went down like through Prescott? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: No, it was the Santa Fe, went straight through. But there was a cutoff that turned and went down. Wait a minute, I'm telling you wrong. It cut off THIS side of Williams, went to the <Grand Canyon>. I can't remember where the cutoff was that went to <Phoenix>, but it was west of the <Grand Canyon> cutoff somewhere. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh-huh, like <Ash Fork>, and that. 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Uh-huh. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well, what was <Phoenix> like when you visited? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Around the size of <Flagstaff> today, around 25,000. They had paved streets and streetcars. You could go all over town on the streetcars. There were no paved streets, you know, when I came - roads or anything. <Flagstaff> had one paved block around the Babbitt block downtown. And there was no such a thing as a paved highway - wasn't in existence. In fact, where [Highway] 89 now turns off up there, the road was there, of course it was a dirt road, but there was a big prairie dog colony right in the middle of the [road]. (laughter) There was one house between San Francisco Street, east of San Francisco Street on [Route] 66. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: One house? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: One house. And you know, 3,000 people aren't very many people. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: A lot of 'em, I suppose, were still scattered out in farm areas. 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Oh, yes, lots of big farms off the highway. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: It must have been right around Prohibition time when you came here, wasn't it? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Yes. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember much about that? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: No, not particularly. Before I came here, they said I think there were thirteen saloons in one block on Santa Fe. And the women wouldn't go down that street a'tall. As long as Lura Kinsey lived, she would never walk down that street, because when she was a child growing up, women didn't do it, didn't walk on that street. Of course there were no saloons when I came. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh-huh, because they were closed because of the period of time. Do you remember anything about bootleggers in the area? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: No. I wasn't interested in liquor problems. (laughs) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember how the Depression affected <Flagstaff>? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: We were the only county in the state that never went in the red during the Depression. I don't know if that meant we had the unsual resources, which we do have, or good management on the part of the officials. So we have the Santa Fe taxes, and they're enormous. And now, of course, we have the taxes from the gas line, too. But then we had the Santa Fe. We were the only ones that stayed in the clear. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did they have to lay off many teachers? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: They didn't lay any off, but they reduced our salaries decidedly. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: By about how much? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: I was cut from $1,800 down to $1,200. We were ALL cut, badly. They said it was either that or let 'em go, and they didn't want to let any of 'em go. So they cut the salaries. That was the main effect of the Depression here. I think probably people were out of work, but I don't know anything about that. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember the Second World War, how it affected <Flagstaff>? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: THAT is when <Flagstaff> began to grow. They put the Ordnance [depot] out for that. Up until then, <Flagstaff> had remained small, but once they got that out there, people just came in, and it's never stopped growin' since. But that was the first start in becoming a regular city, growth. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you notice a big increase in your classroom size? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Oh, yes, and another thing, we had youngsters that moved all the time. Those people at the Ordnance would come in, then first thing you know, they'd move out, some MORE would come in. That's when we began to have this constantly moving population, and they still have a little bit of that, but not like it was then. All during the war, that population moved constantly. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: So you'd just have the children for a few months and then they would just move away. 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Then they left. That was the main effect on the school. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any large fires in <Flagstaff>? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: No. The big fires were all ahead of my time, when the town burned down. I can't remember any right now, very big ones. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: And do you remember any flooding in <Flagstaff>? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Yes, I can remember in '23 when we moved into the high school, it rained for three days without stopping, and the walks weren't in, there were no walks. The street stopped at Humphrey, it didn't go on to the high school, except as a little trail, you know. I had to climb up and walk on the stone wall to get in. And then they called off school. And the south part flooded. And it flooded several times after that. The River de Flag spreads out over there, somewhere, I don't know how. But there was a terrific flood over there. It never [flooded] up here, we don't get it, but the south part of town got it. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What about the big drought that hit <Flagstaff>? Do you remember those ________? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Oh, they come every so often. I don't remember any special one. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was there one in the thirties, where they had to bring water in from <Winslow>? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Oh, I know what you mean now. The first of those came… I don't remember the exact year, that was probably the one, came in February or March, and we had no water for a while. Most of our water we carried from the big spring over on the hill. That's a spring out here where the Coke(?) place is now. 



[END TAPE 1, SIDE 1; BEGIN TAPE 1, SIDE 2] 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh-huh. 



OLIVE McNERNEY: There was one other one, but I don't remember when the other one was. There hasn't been once since - well, last summer was dry, but not bad - there hasn't been another since.... Well, there was one more after that. (tape turned off and on) The first one was in the twenties, and they didn't ship in water, we had to depend on the springs. But the second one - I can't tell you the date - we did ship in water, and we had water in the pipes. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: It came out, you could still turn on your faucets? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: They put it in the pipes. You could get some from your faucets, the rest we'd go downtown and get. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh! now how did you get it downtown? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: There was a place down there where they had it fixed up so you could fill your bottles and everything if you wanted to. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did they charge you a fee then? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Well, it came through the regular city water company. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, I see, you just received your regular bill. That's interesting. Any blizzards or very big snows that you remember? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Yes, '37 was a terrific year, and so was '46, I think it is. In '37, we had five feet on the level. (chuckles) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did they keep the schools open? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Most of the time. See, we didn't have the buses then. Now, they have to close on account half the kids come on buses and if they can't get here, then you close school. But we didn't have any bused students then, except for they just absolutely couldn't at first bell couldn't get there, we kept open most of the time. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: You had to walk? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Uh-huh. Of course I had to walk clear down to the old Emerson School then. (laughs) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Five feet of snow! Do you remember any of the big epidemics or illnesses? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Well, we closed the school for a month one time for polio. There were several cases in town. We were closed a month then. And we were closed a month during the first flu epidemic. That came during World War II, because the teachers who stayed in town worked on the draft board while we were out of school. So that's how I know it was in World War II. That was a terrible one. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you notice a large reduction in the student population? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: No. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: It didn't affect the students as badly as.... 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Oh, not noticeably, as we were out of school during the worst of it. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any black families in the community, or Negro families? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: There was only one when I came, and that was the Dorsey family. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Where did they live? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Over on South San Francisco, I think it is, I'm not sure. One son and his wife still live over there. The children are gone. We had all the children in high school. It was when they built the new mill that the colored people came in. That was a <Louisiana> concern, and they brought them in with them to work. That's when our Negro population - it was shortly after that, that the Negro school was built to take care of 'em. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Where did the Dorsey family go to school, then, before then? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: There was only one of 'em in school here - it was my first year here. She'd been at the Training School, and the middle of the year, she came over to our school. And from there on, they all went - beginning with the ninth grade they went into the white school. Later they closed the school and put 'em all in the other schools. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any Oriental families, Chinese families? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Well, there's some still here, the June family. Some of them are still here. They were the only Chinese family here when I came. They ran a restaurant down on Front Street - Front Street they called it - Santa Fe. And then these Wongs came later. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: They just went to school at Emerson? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Uh-huh. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Where did the Mexican-American children go to school? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: After they left their primary school where they learned their English, they went into the public schools. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did most of them live down in the south part of town? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Nearly all of 'em lived there then. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember when tourism started in <Flagstaff> - just about? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: I couldn't tell you. I couldn't even make a guess at it. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was there more after the Second World War than before, do you think? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Oh, there wasn't ANY before the world war. Everybody who went to the canyon went on the train, you know, so there was none then. And I can't tell you when it started. I suppose there wasn't any heavy tourism until the roads were all paved, because the old cars couldn't take much of the dirt roads, you know. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you go to the <Grand Canyon> fairly early? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: October '23 was my first trip over there. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was it like? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Well, much like today, only there were only two big hotels, El Tovar, and Bright Angel was just one building then, a big wooden building which was later torn down when this second one was built. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you go down into the canyon? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Yes, but not then. I guess it must have been '27 or '28 before I took a mule trip down in. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you camp out when you got down there? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: No, we just went down and back the same day. Haven't been on a mule since! 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember when East <Flagstaff> started to develop? Do you remember much about that area? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Well, that is fairly recent. I'm not going to make a guess as to when. It's what I would have called recently. I told you, you know, there was only one house east of San Francisco when I came. But I wouldn't make a guess. 



If I'm not mistaken, though, I'm sure that Babbitts opened their store out there in '52. And it wasn't the first store out there, there were some others out there, that had been before then. I don't know when it started, though. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Any children that lived over in that area that had to come to school over here? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: 'Cause there weren't buses, they either walked in or their family brought them. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: When did bussing start? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: That's another thing I'm not going to guess about, I don't know. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: But it must have been in the late forties or fifties? Fairly recently? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: No, it was before the fifties. (pause) It seems to me that it must have started about the time the Ordnance came, because I know the Ordnance children were brought in here to school. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were the children that lived out at the logging camps and the Lake Mary area, do you know if there were many people living out there then? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Yes, there were, but they had their own school. There was a school out there, it's still out there. I know the name of that camp and can't think of it. If they came into high school, the parents usually would move in town - one of them would move in town so that the children could go to high school, if the children wanted to go on. There were no buses then to bring 'em in. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: So I imagine that a lot of the children then.... 



OLIVE McNERNEY: <Happy Jack>! was the camp I was trying to think of. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: So a lot of the children never got past grammar school education then? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: Well, I imagine some. I don't think it was too many, but I imagine quite a few of 'em probably quit after the eighth grade and went to work somewhere, but I don't know. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, can you think of anything else you'd like to talk about? 



OLIVE McNERNEY: I think you've covered everything rather thoroughly.
