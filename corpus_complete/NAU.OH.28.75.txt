This is an interview with Mr. Orville Pendergrass, who has lived in <Flagstaff> since 1910. His parents homesteaded out in the Doney Park area for a number of years. The interview is being conducted on July 27, 1976, at Mr. Pendergrass' home, which is located at 209 North Elden in <Flagstaff>, by Kristine Prennace representing the Flagstaff City-Coconino County Public Library. [Narrator's wife, Hazel Campbell Pendergrass, is also present, but in the next room, and makes a few comments. (Tr.)]

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Mr. Pendergrass, when and where were you born?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Born in <Colorado>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you mind giving the year?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No, not at all! January 11, 1902.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Who were your parents?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: You want their first and last names?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: My parents were Ada and Frank Pendergrass.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was your mother's maiden name, if we can get that?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Ada Robertson.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Robertson?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Roberts, yes.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, were they from <Colorado> originally?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No. They were originally from <Alabama>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh! uh-huh, Southerners that moved into that area.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Uh-huh.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, what did your father do, what kind of work?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Well, he was just a little bit of a jack of all trades. He had worked in the coal mines, he had farmed, and his real trade that brought us here was the butcher trade - he was a slaughter butcher.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh! So you came here when you were very young?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yes.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Your parents moved here. Okay, why don't we get the year then. Do you remember the year you came?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: We came here in 1910, November.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Then who did your father work for?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: He worked for Babbitts'.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, downtown?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No, out south of town, where the slaughterhouse was.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: How much farther out of town was that?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Just west of where the new south campus is.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh! okay, it was quite a ways.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Just about where the county barn is. The county place there, that's where the slaughter pens were.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh! Well, there wasn't any I-17 there?! (laughs)

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Just like a dirt road?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: It was all dirt, too, no pavement.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Then you had some of your schooling in <Flagstaff>?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yes.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Which school did you go to?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Went to the Emerson.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any of your teachers very well?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yeah, I remember both of 'em. My third-grade teacher was Miss Green, and my third-grade teacher was Lenore Francis. [Sounds to me like he was saying "third-grade" for both teachers. (Tr.)]

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was she any relation to John Francis?

PENDERGRASS: She was his daughter.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh! Okay. Did you have brothers and sisters?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yes, when I came here I had four brothers and two sisters.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Why don't we go ahead and get their names on tape, because they lived here too.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: My oldest brother's name when we came here was Arthur. My next brother's name was Earl. My youngest brother's name was Robert. My sisters' names, the first one, the oldest, was Blanche. The other two that was born here was Ruth and Rose.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Are any of them still living in <Flagstaff>?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No. No, they're all gone, all gone.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any special daily chores you had to do growing up, around the house?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Not until we moved out to Doney Park.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, you lived out in THAT area.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yeah, my dad homesteaded out there.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Where did you live when you first came to <Flagstaff>?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: We lived in a house catty-corner across the street from Andy's Liquor Store, where the post office building is.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, yeah, okay.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: There was a house there. And that was furnished, of course, by Babbitts' - they furnished the house when we moved here. And then we later moved TO the slaughterhouse and lived out there for two years, 'til we moved to the country.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh. Now, how did you get into school from....

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Foot.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You had to walk?!

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: We walked to school.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: That's a long way.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: It was about a mile-and-a-half. Not too bad.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: In the snow is not real good! (laughs)

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: We went to school in the wintertime, just the same as summer.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: So you lived out in THAT area, out by the slaughterhouse. Was yours the only home out there?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yes, that was the only home there, just a place for the ones that was workin' there.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was there anything between you and, say, where Old 66 goes now, down by Holiday Inn and all that? That was pretty much mill area, wasn't it?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: It was ALL mill area.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was there much between you and the mill?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Just a very few houses. We walked the railroad tracks because we could get up on the ties and stay out of the mud. (KP laughs) The track run right down along past where the slaughterhouse was - the mill tracks, the railroad. And when we started school, we'd just get over on the railroad, follow it to town.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was the school day long then?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Eight to five.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, really?!

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Eight to four.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: That IS a long day. Were there many of the mill children that would go up to school too with you? Were there quite a few of you that _______.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: There was a few of 'em. We usually met with another family when we got to the mill. Their folks worked there, or the dad worked at the mill, and we all went down to the school together.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any classmates particularly well?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Oh yes, some of 'em. Not especially in my room . Claude Black, I can remember him. He was in my grade. And Gaston Aubineau, he was in my grade. Buzz Gregg, he was a grade below me.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Part of the Gregg family?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yeah.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember anyone else particularly well?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Not that was in my immediate grade, but I can remember some of the other boys who went to school: the Comptons, the Treats, the rest of 'em, you know. The Gregg family.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember the Hoffmans?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yes, a Hoffman was in my grade.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was that Floyd?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Floyd Hoffman.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You mentioned Claude Black - did you know a Rusty Black? I'm sure it's a nickname.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Not a Rusty Black. I used to know somebody by the name of Rusty, but I don't remember what his last name was.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: I was given his name, and I haven't been able to locate him. So then your family moved out to Doney Park. (

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Uh-huh.)

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were you still in school?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: There WAS no school out there. We was there for a couple of years, or a year-and-a-half before they ever got a school out there.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh! so you just worked on the place?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: We just worked around the place.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What did you raise out there?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Oh, in those years we raised potatoes and grain, mostly for sale; and hay. And we raised lots of vegetables for our own use in a garden. The weather was different in those days. We had more moisture, longer summers.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You had the original 160 acres to homestead?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yes.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were there many people out in that area then?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: There was three other places when we homesteaded - three other farms in Doney Park.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember who owned them?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Joe Challis had a homestead, and Milt Farrell had a homestead.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did they pretty much raise the same types of things?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: It was all potatoes and grain.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you ever meet Ben Doney?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yes, I knew him well.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What kind of person was he?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Well, he was quite a peculiar person. (laughter) He was an old Civil War veteran, and he had a half a dozen gold mines and silver mines, claims all over the country, scattered north of town, and they were ALL gonna be fabulously rich, but they all turned out to be sulphur.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did he ranch out in that area?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: He had a homestead in Black Bill Park.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, where is that?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Black Bill Park is the one on beyond Doney Park, on 89.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, okay. It's just a different area?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yeah, just different area. There's two parks, Black Bill Park and Doney Park. Doney Park is the first one that you come to out there on the right.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: And he didn't live in Doney Park?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No, Doney Park - that was always a mystery to us kids. We couldn't figure out why Doney didn't live in Doney Park.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, he must have been quite old when you knew him.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yes, he was an old man when I knew him.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did he live here for many years then after you knew him?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: As far as I know. I don't know whether he died here, or died someplace else, but he left here. He was around here for several years.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did he have any family at all?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: He had a boy, a son someplace. I never did see him - I'd heard of him. We never did see him. Somebody said he had a daughter, but I never did see them.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: So his family wasn't with him?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No. He was a bachelor ever since we knew him.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was the <Flagstaff> downtown area like when you were growin' up?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Pretty much the same, laid out the same way. About the only way it's changed, it's expanded, some of the buildings has been rebuilt. And since we've been here, I don't believe, I can't remember a fire that's really done any real damage to the downtown area. Business has just gradually grown up, and the residential district has just backed away from it.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh-huh, because the residential area used to be right down....

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Right down close to the middle.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember what kinds of stores and things were downtown?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Babbitts' had the big store downtown, and Switzer had the hardware store. And then Hermans had the clothing store, shoe store.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, it was the Hermans? I've heard their name before. Did you know Sam Finley?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: I knew him - that is, I knew who he was - but personally knowing him, why, it _______. He owned the building that Bill Switzer moved into. He had a store in there before Switzer did.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did the Nackards come much later?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Nackards come… I don't know just exactly what year - along in the teens somewhere.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: So they had been here for quite a while?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Oh yes, they've been here for a long time.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, you probably were in Babbitts' Store quite a bit. Do you remember what the inside looked like?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Not too much different from what it does today. They had the grocery in there then. George Babbitt, Old George, he run the grocery end of it. And then the rest of 'em, one of 'em run the hardware, and one the dry goods, first one thing and another. But he run the grocery.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: So he was right in there working. Do you remember a library downtown?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No! I can't. I was trying to remember today. I can't remember a library downtown. We got all of our books when I was goin' to school from the school library.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was that pretty small at that time, the school library?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No, I think they had a pretty good supply of books. They had all the history books and everything like that. I can remember a bunch of the history books we used to get.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: A lot of people can't remember if there was....

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: I just don't remember another library until they put that one in down on Aspen. Do you, hon?

HAZEL PENDERGRASS: Yes, there was one upstairs, across from Babbitts', in that building. I'm trying to think who the librarian was. Miss DeVaney, Lucina DeVaney. It was upstairs, and I don't know what the name of that building is.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Keller's Bakery, over in that area?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yeah. Above Keller's Bakery.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was Front Street still pretty rough when you were growing up?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: We weren't allowed on Front Street.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You weren't? (laughs)

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: And that was the only bookstore in town where you could buy books for school and school supplies. There was a newsstand and a bookstore and it was run by a guy by the name of [Balzar] Hock. They called it Hock's Newsstand.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: That was right down on Front Street?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Next to the Rose Tree. That trader's in there now, that Indian trader. He's in there. J.C. Brown bought it from Hock. He moved in there. But when we first come here, we weren't allowed.... That is, some of the time we had to go, if we had to go get somethin' to go for school, and a woman wasn't allowed down there at all. And our dad had to take us. Every other door was a saloon and a bunch of cowboys with their big pistols stickin' on their hips. The kids just didn't go down there.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: It was a pretty colorful place?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: It was. It was a Wild West town then.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: I suppose people just rode their horses into town, right?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yeah, it was hitchin' racks around every block.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: It's hard to imagine. And the roads were all dirt?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: All dirt. There was no paving.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was it kept pretty clean?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yeah, they kept 'em pretty clean. They drug just as much as they could in the wintertime. Of course, there wasn't much they could do with it.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did they have like a regular crew that would go around?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: I don't know. I don't remember whether there was a regular city crew, or whether it was the county that done it.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any hospitals in town?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: The hospital was over there next to the AL and T Mill, in a building over there. The only hospital that we knew until this other one was built.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, when this other one was built, it was very small, wasn't it, to start?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Not too small. I think they had about twelve, fifteen beds when they first built it.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, for a small town, I guess that was pretty good-sized then.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yeah.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember, that little while that you were living downtown, any of your neighbors down in there?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Just the one family, the Aubineaus. They lived across the street from us.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you know what Mr. Aubineau did?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No, I don't remember what HE did. I know what the boy was doin'. He was just goin' to school like we were. That was Gaston. I think there was more than one boy, but Gaston, I can remember him, because we used to [cuss?] with him all the time.

HAZEL CAMPBELL PENDERGRASS: (far from microphone, inaudible)

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yeah, his father.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any other personalities in town very well? Say the Babbitts, or anyone particularly well?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No. We went to school and come home. Well, now, there was.... When I come home from school, my brother and I, as a rule we went to work. We had a whole bunch of jobs around town, taking wood into people's houses, or stacking it up. Most everybody had a place, had a big box for their wood, or they put it under the house to keep it good and dry. And it had to be rigged up just so, so that it'd fit. And wood was cut in sixteen-inch lengths and then split. My brother and I, we'd make fifteen, twenty cents a day, going to someone's house.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: That's pretty good!

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Oh, for kids, we were gettin' rich! We did that all summer, both years that we was livin' in town.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: And people pretty much just went out and cut their own wood?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: They bought it.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, they bought it cut.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yeah, most of 'em. I can remember one family especially was the Bellwood. He worked up to the observatory. And there was another one worked up to the observatory, but I can't remember what his name was. I know we got twenty-five cents a day, puttin' the wood in THEIR places. We hit the jackpot!

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, liked workin' for them!

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yeah.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you ever herd the milk cows out for families?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: I know some....

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yeah, some people did. We didn't have anything to herd 'em with - only afoot.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, you didn't have any ponies?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: We didn't have any ponies. When we moved to the Park, there was a doctor here in town, at that time was a good friend of my dad's, and when we moved to the Park, he gave us four burros.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh! So then you had somethin' to ride!

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: We had somethin' to ride.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were burros hard animals, though, to ride?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No, they weren't hard to ride. They weren't bad to buck.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: They'd go when you wanted 'em to?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Well, yeah. Not very fast, but they'd go.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: (laughing while speaking, unintelligible) This is kind of a strange question, it's kind of hard to answer. Do you know much about the social life of the community, what people would get together to do for fun?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Nothin' outside of their dances.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh! Now, where'd they have the dances?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Most of the dances were put on at the Elks Club. I can remember people going' to those, talkin' about [it].

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you know much about the churches in town?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No, very little.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You might remember World War I - you came to <Flagstaff> before that - how it affected the town, do you remember?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Well, I don't know too.... See, we were in the country at that time, and as far as affecting the country, it was more of a blessing to the people that was in the Park out there farming, 'cause then they could sell anything that they raised.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: There was a ready market for it?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: There was a ready market for it then. And of course what hurt the country, too, was after the war, 'cause after the war, why, everything [dropped out?], you couldn't GIVE it away.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: That was just before the Depression?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: That was just BEFORE the Depression, that's what started it. I think that was the START of the Depression.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh-huh, people just couldn't sell stuff, so they __________.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No. And you take your soldiers coming back from overseas - there's no work for 'em. Well, there's no money, they had no money.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, so they couldn't buy anything.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Ah! so that really made it hard. Now, you were still out at Doney Park?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: We lived in the Park from 1913 on.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What did your father do? Did he have a lot of trouble financially, right during the Depression?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Well, he's just like all the rest of 'em - we all had to get out and find some way to make a livin'.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What did you do then?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Well, after we got to where we couldn't sell anything that we raised, some of us worked for the county, some of us worked for the railroad - whatever there was to do.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: So you kind of held other jobs besides trying to work the place?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Uh-huh. And my dad later on come in town and went to work in a garage here, in a shop. And that kept the wolf from the door.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: So you were pretty hard-hit by the Depression.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Oh, yes. Yeah, out here that hit hard.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you think a lot of the homesteaders lost their land during the Depression? In this area, do you know of many that did?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Well, I don't know whether.... I was trying to think when it was that they all sold out. The weather changed, they couldn't raise anything. I've seen the years, the time out there in the Park, when you couldn't raise enough hay on a forty-acre field to feed a milk cow over the winter. And that's just the way the weather was, there wasn't enough moisture.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: So there wasn't a thing you could do about it.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No, there wasn't nothin' you could do. Had to get out and go to work. And before the war and right after the war, if it hadn't been for George Babbitt, the old George Babbitt, there in the store, there'd have been many a hungry kid. Everything we bought on credit for over a year. Didn't buy it by the month, we bought it by the year. And whenever they harvested, they paid off. The store would carry 'em for a year. And then it got down to where they couldn't afford to do it, and they just had to cut it out, and it made it tough on a lot of people. And really, I don't think the Babbitts ever lost anything for their generosity.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh-huh, people paid up.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: I think they did.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: It's just the NUMBER of people that they would have to carry for the year probably got too.... So was that the time when you started working? What kind of job did you have then?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: The first job I had away from home was out here west of town. I was drivin' a four-up, four mules on a fresno, helpin' build the road goin' over, out here by Woody Mountain Campgrounds, where it goes over the hill. I was buildin' that grade in there. My job was one of the fresno operators, and I had four mules to take care of, and I was gettin' a dollar-and-a-half a day and board.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, a fresno, I'm sorry, I don't....

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Well, that's a scraper that drags dirt. You fill it with dirt behind the team. You've got another team that goes ahead of you and plows this dirt up in a pit, and then you go into the pit with your four mules hooked to this fresno. It's got a johnson bar on it that you hold, and you tip it up just like a scoop. And then push back on what we call the drawbar, push back on it to hold the dirt in. And maybe you drag it a couple hundred yards to the highway.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: That's a hard way to build a road!

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: That's a hard way to build a road - that's the only way they had.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, boy!

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: That was the first job that I had. I worked one summer out there for a dollar-and-a-half a day and board. And that was ten hours a day. You got up, you had your team ready to go at seven o'clock. You harnessed 'em and then after you harnessed your teams and took care of 'em, went to breakfast. And then after breakfast you got your team __________ the grade, and you didn't leave the grade until twelve o'clock. And then you had one hour to feed your team, grain your teams, and get your lunch and get back on the road.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: And then how late did you work?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Five o'clock. Worked eight hours every day.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: That is a LOT of hard work. So then when you did that, when you were through with that job, what did you do?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Well, we figured we'd have enough money by the time we got through with that job to last us maybe a couple three months during the winter. And then it was just odd jobs.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Whatever you could ______.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Whatever we could pick up from the other ranchers or....

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You had a job throughout the years, didn't you, after that? You didn't just odd job?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: In 1931, I went to work for the highway department then on maintenance.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: And then you stayed with them?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: For ten years.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: On maintenance, what type of things [did you do]?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Oh, maintaining roads, puttin' a surface on, diggin' the rocks out, runnin' the equipment that they had. They had graders, power graders. Some of 'em pulled with trucks, and others run on their own power.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were there many paved roads to work on?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: There was only one paved road. It was paved in 1926 and '27, from here to Canyon Padre, was the only paved - outside of around town - there was a little pavin' around town.

[END TAPE 1, SIDE 1; BEGIN TAPE 1, SIDE 2]

KRISTINE PRENNACE: (laughs) So you could go through!

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yeah.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What kind of snow removal did they have?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Well, when I first went to work for the highway department, they didn't have any. All they had was a truck.

HAZEL CAMPBELL PENDERGRASS: Didn't they have graders?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: That's what I was gonna tell her, we had a grader that we pulled behind the truck.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Just like ONE grader?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: One grader, one man that stayed out in the snow on the grader, operating it, and the guy in the truck could get warm.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You always hoped you were the one in the truck.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: And then later on, in the thirties, they got some better equipment, big equipment, big plows, big trucks with plows on the trucks.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, yeah, to scoop it out of the way. People just didn't get out much before that, then, did they? When it would snow heavy, you'd just have to stay home?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Have to stay home. The next day you had some way you could get there, get the roads plowed out to the highway.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well, when you were a little kid, what kind of snow removal did they have?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: None.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you shovel the roads?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: You'd just shovel the road. They had what they called a "V" plow, just a board cut up about eighteen inches high, with a bar on the bottom, so it wouldn't be draggin' on the wood. And it was built in a "V" shape. And they'd hook maybe six or eight head of horses on the front of it and drag that around from one place to another, 'til they got to the highway, and that's what the highway used too. They didn't try to make any effort to try to keep the roads open.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well, there just wasn't any way to do that.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: They couldn't KEEP 'em open that way.

HAZEL CAMPBELL PENDERGRASS: People weren't goin' anyplace anyhow!

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, just stayin' in town.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: And in the country, you usually figured that you had enough groceries to last the whole winter.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, yeah, uh-huh.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: If they dwindled, we figured maybe during the winter we'd go to town around Christmastime. But that's the only time we went to town.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You had like a sleigh or something that you would _____.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Uh-huh, we had sleds.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: While we're kind of on the subject of snow, didn't your wife mention having to blast the snow?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yes, that was in 1937, and we had I don't know how much. We was living north of town here on the divide on 89, where the road goes over the crest out there, they had a highway maintenance camp there. It snowed and it blowed. And it would snow and we'd open the road, and it would close it. And we'd plow it, and it'd close it again. And we just kept that up until we got blocked, we couldn't get out with any of our equipment. And when they finally got a rotary plow, that went in, they had it ordered for a long time, and for months before it ever arrived here. When they brought it in, it was a rotary, like some of the ones the city has now. Grinds the snow up and blows it away. This was a big truck and a good piece of equipment. And we took it out there in the park to start it in, and we got through the soft snow. Then we hit those open lanes, we couldn't budge it. So we go ahead of the plow with a crowbar and dynamite, and every ten feet, we'd put in a stick of dynamite and jar the snow loose so the snowplow could move it. That's the only way we opened the road. There was three miles of that. Finally got the road open.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: That must have been an exceptional year as far as snow.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: It was an exceptional hard year. The only way we could get to town was on a caterpillar, come in on a tractor.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did it snow every day? Like a few years ago we had 200 inches of snow.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Something like that, only we had more wind. The wind blew all the time, the wind didn't quit.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, that's miserable!

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: And it'd blow that snow out of the woods. It had a crust on it, ice, and it was just like sand when we got to where we plowed it up. Then it was just like tryin' to move sand with the plows.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh! that sounds really awful. Well, when did you get married, so I can.... I forgot to ask you that earlier.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: We got married in 1932, wasn't it, hon?

HAZEL CAMPBELL PENDERGRASS: Uh-huh.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: And what's your wife's name?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Hazel.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: And her maiden name?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Campbell.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: No relation to the Campbells in town?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Where did she come from?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: <Colorado>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh! from <Colorado> too! That's [great?]. Okay, and you had children?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Two daughters: a stepdaughter, and a daughter.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: And they were raised in <Flagstaff>?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: They were raised and went to school here.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Why don't I get their first names?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Ruthie was the oldest one. And Patricia is the youngest.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do they still live in <Flagstaff>?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No. Ruthie lives in <Tucson>, and Patricia lives in <Prescott>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: They aren't too far away, then.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Oh, no.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, when they were going to school then, what school did they go to?

HAZEL CAMPBELL PENDERGRASS: (inaudible, far from microphone)

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: That's right, Training School. I was trying to think. I knew she didn't go to Emerson.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, so it was on the university campus?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yeah.

HAZEL CAMPBELL PENDERGRASS: And our oldest girl, Ruthie, went to school out at Cliffs. I don’t suppose you have the slightest idea where Clifs is. Well, its oout about where Greenlaw stuff…right around the new shopping center and the school there.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: That was called Cliffs, out by the Greenlaw area?

HAZEL CAMPBELL PENDERGRASS: Uh-huh, farther on down a little ways.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Pardon me, hon. There was a section on the railroad, a section house, where the section crews lived. On the railroad there was a section building on the railroad every six miles. And there was one here in <Flagstaff> and one in Cliffs, and that's where the mill was, was at Cliffs - where the sawmill was. That was the Greenlaw Mill.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, you lived out in this area then even after you got married?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No. We was on the divide line when I got married, working for the highway department. When we got married.... I was trying to think of which camp we was in. Was it Tanner's Wash, hon?

HAZEL CAMPBELL PENDERGRASS: Uh-huh.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Tanner's Wash? That's right where you said, like at....

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No, Tanner's Wash was a hundred miles north of <Flagstaff>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: North?! Going towards the <Grand Canyon>?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No, going toward <Lee's Ferry>, going towards Page.

HAZEL CAMPBELL PENDERGRASS: (inaudible)

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh. Was that then just a....

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Just a maintenance camp, highway maintenance camp.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: There wasn't much out there then?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Wasn't ANYTHING out there.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Nothin' out there at all.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: And in the wintertime, the roads on the North Rim was blocked, so there was nothin' ___________ just out there.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Really isolated. Was there much at Lee's Ferry then? Just the ferry?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No, there wasn't no ferry there. When we was workin' there, the ferry had been gone for a long time. It was brigged out. They had a bridge… we went out there in order to put the bridge in.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: I didn't ask you about the Prohibition period. Do you remember much about that?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Not too much. It didn't bother us kids much. Let's see, they voted that out in 1917, 1918.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Ah, okay. Do you remember what effect it had like on Front Street? Did they just close up the bars?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No, they stayed open.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: They did?!

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Sure, they was supposed to be sellin' near-beer, but they weren't. They were sellin' home brew and moonshine liquor. They turned 'em into pool halls instead of bars.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, I see. Let's see, we didn't talk about World War II yet either, what kind of effect it had on <Flagstaff>.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Well, I don't think it had much more of an effect on it than the first one did, financially. Everybody worked, there was all the work in the world. There was plenty of work when the war was going on. But it was after the war, that's what hit everybody. If a person had a steady job, they was all right. If they didn't have a steady job, why, it was pretty bad.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Right after the Second World War?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yeah, right after the Second World War.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Ah! so there was a little bit of recession?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: There was a little bit in that.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, were you still working with the roads then?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: About half of the war, we worked 'til '42, '43. In '42 we all got fired. There was no use sayin' I didn't, I just got canned. We went to work for a contractor, and went to <Vegas>, went to work.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, up in <Las Vegas>?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yeah, went to <Las Vegas>, buildin' houses.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: So were you there for quite a while?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: We was there a few months, and then we moved from there to <Tucson>. And we was down there 'til very near the time the war was over. The house we was livin' in, the party we was rentin' from, he was workin' in an airplane factory in <California>, and he let us… give us notice that he was gonna hafta have his house back, couldn't find a place to live, so he had to come home, so we come back here. Then I went to work for the city.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: So in <Flagstaff> you worked for the city?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Went to work for the street department.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember when the Ordnance depot was built?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yeah, it was built - started in '42, '43.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: So it was just before then you left?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Uh-huh.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember when <Flagstaff> really started to grow? Do you think it was right around that time?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Around that time, I think. We started to grow after World War II.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any real big fires or anything in town?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Not in town, I can't remember any big fires.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What about any flooding?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Flooding? Yes, we used to have floods. The whole south side of town used to get flooded prit near every time the snow melted.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, in the spring then?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: In the spring.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did the summer rains have much effect on it?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: I don't remember any in the summertime, do you, hon?

HAZEL CAMPBELL PENDERGRASS: What's that?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Floods, over on the south side.

HAZEL CAMPBELL PENDERGRASS: I remember one time ____________ when the River de Flag ____________.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: That was in the spring, wasn't it?

HAZEL CAMPBELL PENDERGRASS: I don’t remember.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Well, I don't either. I don't remember whether it was spring or summertime, but I've seen the south side flooded several times.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Just a low spot?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yeah, that's ALL low over there. It's just like out here north of town, out at, oh, Flagstaff High School, new high school, north, up the draw, up the River de Flag. We used to call that the mud hole out there. Every time it stormed, that country _____ everytime the river run, that country was flooded. That's all low in there.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Huh. Is that where they built all those homes, the Mountainview Homes?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Uh-huh.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: They must have really had to work at....

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Well, they could be flooded, any big storm would flood 'em out if they got the right kind of a storm.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Mm, so it's still pretty bad?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yeah, it'd still be bad.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: We talked a little bit about the dry years, about the effect at least on the ranchers. Do you remember any years particularly well that it was so dry, water shortages?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: (long pause) Well, I think it started dryin' up in 1921. That's when really the drought started, and it lasted all through the twenties, and a lot up into the thirties. There wasn't enough moisture in those years that we could raise a good potato crop. They could raise beans, but they couldn't raise potatoes.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well, those were the same years, wasn't it, that like the Dustbowl area was drying up?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yes.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: (inaudible) Do you remember any of the migrations from the Dustbowl area, people coming from <Oklahoma>?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You were off....

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: We was off of with the highway.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: So they didn't ever come to the door? (no audible response) Let's see, we talked about the snows. Do you remember the snow of 1915-16?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yeah.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you think that was any worse than the one in the thirties?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No. In the thirties they had a little more equipment to move it.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: So they were about the same as far as damage?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yeah. In 1916 is the time it caved in the Orpheum Theater, and Babbitts' livery barn.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, it caved in THAT?!

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yeah.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Wow. That REALLY did a lot of damage then. Do you think it's just that people didn't expect that much and didn't clear the roofs?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No, they didn't think a thing about it. You take four or five feet of wet snow, ain't much you can do with it.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: No. (laughs) Do you remember any epidemics or bad illnesses?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Just the flu epidemic during World War I.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did that affect your family?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Well, we all had the flu. None of us died from it.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You were lucky.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Oh, we were AWFUL lucky.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did the doctor come to your home to visit you? Or did you pretty much have to take care of yourselves?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: More or less took care of ourselves. We had a good friend that took care of us boys, and another good friend that took care of Mother and the girls.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: That's good ________.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: When they needed medicine, or needed the doctor or advice, they'd hook up the buggy and come to town. Then the doctor would always send the medicine that he figured we needed, or had run out of.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: That was a big family, to try and take care…. Let me see, we haven't talked much about the other ethnic groups in town. Do you remember the Mexican-Americans very well that were in town?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yeah, but we never did.... We always got along. As far as I can remember, we got along good, with ALL of 'em. It's just since they, here in the last few years when they get these rabble rousers that winds 'em up, that get's 'em started that causes all the trouble. We never had no trouble with 'em, went to school with 'em.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: I imagine when you lived down by the slaughterhouse (

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yes.) there were quite a few families.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: There was quite a few families goin' to school, black and the Spanish too.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, there were some black families?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: There was some black families here then.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Not very many?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Not very many, and they stayed on their.... There was a black family lived up here on Terrace, a man and his wife, for YEARS, and you couldn't ask for any better people, or any better neighbors.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember when the large group of black people moved in?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: A large black group moved in here when the lumber mills, Flagstaff Lumber Company, they sold out to the Cady Lumber Company. And the Cady Lumber Company came from <Louisiana>. That's all they worked down there was the blacks. And they brought 'em in by the dozens. People squalled about it and they’d quit, and then pretty soon you find out that there's another dozen families been moved in over the weekend.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, the town wasn't real happy about it?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No, they weren't real happy about it a'tall because it took work away from other people who lived here.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were there many Indian families in town?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No, I don't think there was an Indian family in town, up 'til I can remember along in the thirties.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Wow. That's a long time. Did they ever just come into town to shop?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Oh, yes, the Indians did. Yeah, they'd come into town. They'd come in town and freight from here to <Tuba>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh! so they ran their own freight?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yeah. Well, they ran their own freight, and a lot of white people freighted too.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any of the Oriental families that were in town, the Chinese? I don't know, where there any Japanese in town?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: I don't believe there were any Japanese. There was a few Chinese restaurants in town. I don't remember a Chinese laundry, but I remember the Chinese restaurants. That's about all that HAD restaurants here then was Chinese in the early days.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What about tourism? Do you remember when it really started?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: I don't think the tourism started until along in the thirties.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were the roads better then, was that why?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: I think that's what started 'em, was roads gettin' to where they could get through.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were there many out-of-state tourists that you can remember? Was it a lot of just people from <Phoenix>?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No, there was quite a few people from out of state.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: To the <Grand Canyon>, was there some kind of a railroad? I heard something about.... Was that going in the thirties, the railroad?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: That railroad was put in… I don't believe it was before the thirties, though. I forget when they built that road to the canyon, the <Grand Canyon> line. But I know it was there all during the thirties, and it was there during most of all the twenties, too.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You went to Williams to catch that train?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: To catch the train, uh-huh.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you ever go to <Phoenix> much? Or did you ever go to <Phoenix> in the early days?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Well, we went to <Phoenix>, as a rule, in the fall of the year, for the fair. That was about the only time we went to <Phoenix>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: So the fair was a big occasion?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Uh-huh. And as a rule, most all the farmers had some kind of a display of potatoes or grain or something that they had on [credit?], at the fair down there on display. So they took it and went to <Phoenix>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, I see.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Some of 'em went by car, some of 'em went by the train.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you go by car or by train?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: We went by car.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Boy, that was a long trip then, wasn't it?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Two days.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You'd just camp out along the way?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Uh-huh. Usually make Bumblebee, down the other side of <Prescott>, around <Cordes Junction> the first day, and go on into <Phoenix> the next day.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: It was just pretty much dirt road then?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: It was ALL dirt road.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you ever go to <Oak Creek Canyon>?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Oh, yes.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: By car?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: By car. The first time I guess we went to <Oak Creek>, we went by buckboard and spring wagon.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was that a pretty wild trip?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yes, it was.

HAZEL CAMPBELL PENDERGRASS: That's when your dad took your mom and you, and you stayed a whole week?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yeah.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, you stayed there a whole week?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Uh-huh.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Camping and relaxing?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Camping and fishing.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, once you were down into the canyon, were there any roads or anything through it? Or did you just have to kind of hike?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: The roads didn't all go all the way through then, from this end. You could come up, oh, to about.... Just about to <Indian Gardens> from the <Sedona> side. And you couldn't get to <Indian Gardens> from the upper side, 'til they fixed that, finished that road in the middle. And then it was just, you might say.... Well, today they'd say it's a Jeep road. And when they finished it, it was just a buckboard. You wouldn't have dared tried to take a car up over it.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, it was _____________. There wasn't much in <Sedona> then, was there?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No. There wasn't anything in <Sedona> outside of the farms, right in <Sedona>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was it the Jordans?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: The Jordans and the Blacks, the Harts.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, so they were down in there, too. I didn't know. What was a Jordan's name, one of the men? Do you remember any of their first names?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: (chuckles) Hadn't thought about it in a long time. Can't even remember that Jordan's name now that's got....

HAZEL CAMPBELL PENDERGRASS: No. I never did know.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: I can't even remember that one that's got that place down there, and I knew him well, but I just don't remember his name. He had that orchard right in <Sedona>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah. Someone had mentioned him also, and I didn't know how to contact him if I didn't know his first name. (laughs)

Now, in East <Flagstaff> - well, you were beyond East <Flagstaff> out in Doney Park - but do you remember what was out there?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: East <Flagstaff>? There was two farms out there, two homesteads.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you know who owned them?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Greenlaw owned one of 'em. And I was trying to think whether it was Greenlaw or Beasley. Beasley, I guess, owned the other one.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh-huh, Al?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Al Beasley. He had the other one. It was two 160-acre homesteads out there, and it was all farmin' land. There was no housing projects at all out there then. There was a big dairy barn on 66, which is 66 now, oh.... I was trying to think about just the exact spot where it would be. He had a dairy.

HAZEL CAMPBELL PENDERGRASS: Mr. Johnson, wasn’t it?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Uh-huh. I was trying to think about the exact spot it would be in.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: The Johnsons, is that the William Johnson family? Did you know him?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: I don't remember his first name. It was Johnsons, you know, Johnson's dairy. But I don't remember....

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were the Garings out there also?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Garings? No, they were west of <Flagstaff>. They were where the Zanzucchis are now. That's where the Garings were.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did the Greenlaws have like a little motor court or a little tourist....

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Later on they did. I guess that's probably the first motor court in town, was there at Greenlaws'.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: That was pretty rough.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yes, it was.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, do you remember the Fourth of July celebrations? Do you remember what that was like as a kid?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: I can remember one: it wasn't a little one, it was a big one. They had contestants here from <Hollywood>. They had prizes, $1,500, $2,000 for bronc riding and steer wrestling. Of course they didn't get that money, the guys that ran off with it…(laughing while talking, unintelligible). It was for a whole week. It was over where the college stadium is now. In that flat in there was the fairgrounds. They had a half-mile track in there. And the grandstands was over against where the cemetery is now.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh-huh, that over there. You had fireworks and everything?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: They had everything. I don't think there wasn't anything that they couldn't think of. They used to have some pretty good rodeos.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was that in the teens?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yeah, that was in the teens, or the twenties.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember when they started the Pow Wow?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: I don't remember what year they started the Pow Wow, the exact year. I guess I remember just about the first one that they had, but I don't know what year it was.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: I think it might have been in the thirties.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: I think it was, too. I think it was around '32, '33, along in there - maybe later.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did a lot of people come to town for that?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Oh, yes. Yeah, there was a lot of people come in for that. (pause) _____________ hauled water.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, yeah, good, tell me about that.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: We hauled it on burros.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You hauled water into the city park on burros.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: ON burros, with burros. We had four burros, and two of 'em were a big husky jack and a jenny, and we had pack saddles and what we called kayak boxes for 'em. This doctor gave us [this] so we could get this water. Well, we hauled water three miles from a spring up at the Elden. And each kayak box would hold two 5-gallon _________ square gasoline cans. Ten gallons in each box in these cans. And we'd go to the spring and get....

[END TAPE 1, SIDE 2; BEGIN TAPE 2, SIDE 1]

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh boy, I keep _________. (laughs) Hauling water that way is really.... Now, how many times a week did you have to make that trip?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Every day.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Every single day?!

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Every day.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: That was like a kids' job?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Uh-huh, whichever one didn't do it the day before had to do it the next day. (laughter) But some days we'd only take one burro and one load.

HAZEL CAMPBELL PENDERGRASS: Tell her how you got your water in winter.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: That's interesting. We melted snow.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, you'd just scoop up the snow in big cans?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Uh-huh.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: And melt it?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Get us a big piece of sheet metal, set this big sheet metal up over a bonfire outside, put a tub under one end of it and then load the thing up with snow. Some people had big kettles, like a hog kettle. Build a fire under it, fill it with snow, let it melt.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Boy, that's a hard way to get water!

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: It takes an awful lot of snow to fill up one milk cow.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, I bet, yeah. I didn't even think about it. And they won't just eat the snow, will they?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Well, they'll eat it, but they won't survive on it. But you can take a whole tubful of water that you worked awful hard to get melted, and water your cow and stand there and watch her drink every drop of it.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, yeah, I didn't even think about all the livestock you had. You didn't have like a tank or anything out there for 'em?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Well, we did, but we'd usually run out of water.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: And so those trips to the Elden Spring....

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Well, we didn't have a cow or anything to water then. The only water we had to make was just for our own use.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Your farming was mostly dry farming?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yes, it was all dry farming.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You get pretty good crops, except during a dry year?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: During the good wet years, we got good crops.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you plant just before the summer rains?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Uh-huh, we'd plant along, the last of May. We used to start plantin' potatoes the tenth of May. And we'd get through by ________. It all depends on how many acres they was gonna put in. But one planter could just _________: one-row planter, you could only plant about three-and-a-half acres a day.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: That’s a lot to plant.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: And if you was gonna plant many acres, as a rule most of 'em switched with somebody, trade with 'em, run two planters for five days, and then switch with the others, go over to his place and plant for five days.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh!

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: So you get most of 'em in, in a hurry. Then they finally got some two-row planters, then they could go faster.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: So in the harvest did you help each other also?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Uh-huh, same way.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You almost had to to get your work done. (tape turned of and on) So you didn't have any electricity or any kind of power out there, did you?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: No. No, there was no electricity of any kind out there then.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: So you just had a gas....

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: What gasoline you have, what gasoline you use in your car, that was your power.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You couldn't even have gas lights?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yes, you could.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, you did have gas lights?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Later on. First we only had kerosene, and then later on when they got the gasoline lamp perfected, we had gas lamps, gas lanterns.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: It took a long time to get electricity to East <Flagstaff>, so I imagine a long time after that before it got out to Doney Park.

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Yeah, we was gone _________.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Gone before. (tape turned off and on)

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Well, it rained, started in raining, and it rained and rained five days. And the River de Flag, it flooded, and flooded the south side of town. Lake Mary ran over, and <Walnut Canyon> goes through, and 66 east of <Winona>, that's where the railroad crosses <Walnut Canyon>. Well, it washed the railroad out. Nobody knew anything about it 'til a freight train of grapes hit the washout on the other side of the bridge and here went the grapes. It was four or five carloads of grapes and [wrecked the whole....?] I guess it was a week before they got the track fixed up to where they could get through.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, so the whole train was just ruined?

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: Well, it didn't ruin the whole train - only about four or five cars tipped over, and one car broke open, and there was grapes everyplace. They couldn't do anything with 'em, they couldn't save 'em, they couldn't salvage 'em. So anybody that wanted grapes could have grapes.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: So you just went out....

ORVILLE PENDERGRASS: I think every rancher in the country had wine. (laughter)

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Sure!
