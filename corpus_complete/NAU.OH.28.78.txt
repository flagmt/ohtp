This is an interview with Mrs. Izora (Speer) Ralston and Mrs. (Speer) Zetta Welch, who are sisters and have lived in <Arizona> since around 1901. The interview is being conducted on June 7, 1976, at their home at 1808 North Izabel in <Flagstaff>. The interviewer is Kristine Prennace representing the Flagstaff City-Coconino County Public Library.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, I could start with Mrs. Ralston. Where and when were you born?

IZORA RALSTON: In <Texas>, the seventh of March, in '89 [March 7, 1889].

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh! Okay. And where were you born?

ZETTA WELCH: I was born in <New Mexico>, down close to <Duncan Arizona>.

(both talking at once, neither discernable)

ZETTA WELCH: So we didn't have any doctors or anything, you know, we just lived out on a farm. And we didn't have any town - it was just an old country, is all - I mean, <New Mexico>, in 1899.

IZORA RALSTON: She was born on my tenth birthday.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: She was?!

IZORA RALSTON: She was a birthday gift.

ZETTA WELCH: We were both the seventh.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, that's really good! What did you say about her birth certificate?

ZETTA WELCH: We don't know how to go about gettin' one, that's all.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, but you did never have any because you were born at home?

ZETTA WELCH: Well, they didn't GIVE any certificate, they just __________.

IZORA RALSTON: I'll tell you where she was born, right out of <Duncan Arizona>, over the line, <New Mexico>. And I think they called that <Graham County>, I'm not sure. I was such a little kid then, I never give it a thought.

ZETTA WELCH: The DOCTOR'S name was Graham, so that's <Graham County>, and <Duncan>, on THIS side, not in <New Mexico> - it's in <Arizona>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, right, okay, I understand. Who were your parents?

IZORA RALSTON: Well, my maiden name was Speer, S P E E R.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, what was your father's name?

IZORA RALSTON: John S.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: And what was your mother's maiden name?

IZORA RALSTON: You mean her maiden name?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Both, yeah.

IZORA RALSTON: Well, of course her name was Speer when she got married, but her name was Hill, Rebecca Hill. And I can't tell you what year she was born.

ZETTA WELCH: I got the card, but I don't know where it is, when she was buried. I don't know what the date is on it.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Where did they come from originally?

IZORA RALSTON: <Texas>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: They were born and raised in <Texas>?

IZORA RALSTON: I don't know for sure. I think my father was born in <Arkansas>. (phone rings, tape turned off and on)

KRISTINE PRENNACE: We were talking about where your mother was born.

ZETTA WELCH: Well, we don't know exactly for sure, but I think she was born in <Texas>. That's what my mother told me, so that's what I went on. Her father… they came from <Louisiana> into <Texas>. My mother was born in <Texas>. So what was the name of that county? Zavala?

IZORA RALSTON: Zavala County, <Batesville>. I don't think my mother was born in <Batesville>, I was. But I don't know for sure, they never GIVE us no history of what, back life, you know. But I just always thought from the way Mama talked that she was born in <Texas>.

ZETTA WELCH: That's what she told me, and I took it.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, what did they do? What did your father do?

IZORA RALSTON: My father was a deputy sheriff there in <Texas> for about thirteen years. And then we left there and come out to <New Mexico>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: When did you leave <Texas>?

IZORA RALSTON: Now, don't ask me that! I wouldn't know. (laughs) You can figure back, though. If I am eighty-six now, I was seven the day we left <Texas>. So you figure by that.

ZETTA WELCH: It says on that....

IZORA RALSTON: I'm not very fast on figurin' out....

ZETTA WELCH: ... my sister, 1898 - 1898 is when they come to this country.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. Well, how did you get from <Texas> to <New Mexico>?

IZORA RALSTON: In covered wagons!

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you?! (laughter) What was that like, do you remember?

IZORA RALSTON: It took us three months and fourteen days to come over. I can't remember the year. Of course I was too little to even THINK of those things then. But I THINK my youngest brother was just about a month or two old, and I think my sister told me that.... No, it wasn't him. But I can't remember. Really, I couldn't tell you [to save my life?].

ZETTA WELCH: But ________ says 1898.

IZORA RALSTON: Huh?

ZETTA WELCH: Eighteen and ninety-eight, we come to <New Mexico>.

IZORA RALSTON: How do you know?

ZETTA WELCH: That's what they had on that piece they put in the paper when she died.

IZORA RALSTON: Maybe so, I don't know. I wouldn't _______.

ZETTA WELCH: That's when they come to <New Mexico>. (both talking at once, neither discernable) ... still there yet.

IZORA RALSTON: Mother probably remembered, you know, but you take kids, they don't think about the years.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: No, unt-uh.

IZORA RALSTON: I know I never kept track of the years 'til I was almost a grown girl - I thought nothin' about it. But I remember I was married the very last night of 1905.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember what the trip was like in the covered wagon?

IZORA RALSTON: Oh, my God! (laughter)

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Tell us a little bit about that.

IZORA RALSTON: Oh, gee, we got lost out on the desert. I don't know how long [we were] out there - a week or so, I think. Not a bite to eat - only Mama would keep some back for the babies, you know. She had two little ones. And I wasn't very big. But I can't remember gettin' very hungry. But finally somebody heard about us, and I think they call that Delaware Desert. Somebody heard about us, and a man come lookin' for us. We'd all started out by that time, we were gonna hunt someplace, you know. I can remember THAT pretty well. He went over there then and worked for this man. I don't know what his name was. It was on… they called it Black River. Of course I was such a little kid, I didn't remember one name from the next, you know - one place from the next. But that's what we done, and I think we was there maybe a month or two, and they stayed there and worked. But they got money enough to go on, and we landed in <New Mexico> next.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: And you were born shortly after that, Mrs. Welch? About a year after?

ZETTA WELCH: Uh-huh. Maybe a year or so after.

IZORA RALSTON: No, it was more than that, because I was just past seven when we got there, you see, and she was born on my tenth birthday.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, so a couple of years.

ZETTA WELCH: My youngest brother, see, he was just a baby. And he was supposed to be two years older than ME.

IZORA RALSTON: My dad's ________ down there.

ZETTA WELCH: And I wasn't born 'til they got to <New Mexico>.

IZORA RALSTON: My grandfather had a farm, and my father farmed that.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, that's what he did in <New Mexico>?

IZORA RALSTON: Uh-huh, part of it.

ZETTA WELCH: Perhaps they might have been there two or three years, in <New Mexico>.

IZORA RALSTON: You know, it's funny, when kids are growing up, they don't think about things like that.

ZETTA WELCH: They're just livin'.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah. (laughter) Right, they don't worry about it. When did you come to <Arizona> then?

IZORA RALSTON: To <Arizona>? We was right on the line of <Arizona> then.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Right there on the border.

IZORA RALSTON: Just right across the line from <Duncan Arizona>. We did all of our trading in <Duncan>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: That's right, okay.

IZORA RALSTON: Then we come from there up to <Scottsdale>, near <Scottsdale>. And I went to school there when I was eleven years old. She wasn't old enough for school yet.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Just a little kid! (laughter) What was <Scottsdale> like at that time?

IZORA RALSTON: Oh, it was just a little ol' camp of a town - looked to me like everybody lived in tent houses. Some people are a little better situated where they had houses, but most people had tent houses. I can remember that.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: It was very small?

IZORA RALSTON: Just a small place. I doubt if you could find yourself in there now. (laughter) You can't tell <Scottsdale>, <Tempe>, and <Mesa>, from <Phoenix> hardly. We lived in <Mesa> for several years, 'til I was about fifteen, I think, when we left <Mesa> - moved up here on Upper Verde.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You were fifteen when you came to Upper Verde then?

IZORA RALSTON: When I come to Upper Verde, I was fifteen.

ZETTA WELCH: Well, when did Dad homestead in <Fort McDowell>?

IZORA RALSTON: Well, criminy, don't ask me that!

ZETTA WELCH: They stayed THERE quite a while.

IZORA RALSTON: I was only a little kid goin' on twelve years old, I guess, when we lived in <Fort McDowell>.

ZETTA WELCH: How long did we live there?

IZORA RALSTON: Just past eleven.

ZETTA WELCH: Anyway, I remember just a tiny bit. Remember the ditch that run by the tent, and lived in mesquites, didn't have any houses.

IZORA RALSTON: Father homesteaded then in <Fort McDowell>. He had two places. He traded his place on ONE side of the river for one on the OTHER side of the river. So that's where we just had more of a house on the other place. (both talking at once, neither discernable)

IZORA RALSTON: I think we went one whole term of school there. We never stayed in one place for a long time. We pulled out and went to <Nogales>, lived in <Nogales> a month or two, and come back up to ________. We was on the road all the time.

ZETTA WELCH: We were pretty good tourists! (laughter)

IZORA RALSTON: Boy! I used to hate that.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: How did you get around, still in a covered wagon at that time? When you moved around, did you still move in a covered wagon?

IZORA RALSTON: Yes! There was no such thing as cars.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Just the covered wagons?

ZETTA WELCH: The only transportation, or what they called a buckboard.

IZORA RALSTON: I know I used to be so ashamed of that I'd duck down where nobody could see me when we'd meet somebody. I was so embarrassed to have to travel like that.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Why? How did everyone....

IZORA RALSTON: Oh, I thought that was terrible!

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Didn't everyone else travel that way?

IZORA RALSTON: Yea. I thought… oh gee, havin' to travel like this is terrible. (laughs) I remember when we came into <Mesa>, the Indians. We'd never seen any Indians. And the Indians would pass us and they'd just giggle and laugh when they'd go by. My brother, he was a big ol' torment anyway. He'd say, "They're makin' fun of you!" Oh! I'd get so mad I'd cry! (laughter) [Well, they were makin' fun of HIM too! (Tr.)]

KRISTINE PRENNACE: There were a lot of Indians in the area then?

IZORA RALSTON: Oh, yeah, they had their reservations. But they traveled a-horseback. Nobody had any cars in THOSE days. I've got some little plates, I want to show 'em to you. One car is made in 1903, and one in 1907, and I never saw a car in all that time. I remember when we moved into <Prescott>, the doctors had a car. You'd see it off in the distance - you'd never see it close to it. My sister was married in 1903 - my older sister.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: How many brothers and sisters did you have?

ZETTA WELCH: There was five girls and five boys.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: A lot!

ZETTA WELCH: My mother had a family!

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were you close to the youngest then?

ZETTA WELCH: I'm the youngest.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You ARE the youngest.

ZETTA WELCH: I was the last of the Mohicans. (laughter)

IZORA RALSTON: She's the tail end.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, maybe we can talk about after you moved up on the Verde, in that area. Now, you were, what… five?

ZETTA WELCH: I was a baby.

IZORA RALSTON: She was about five.

ZETTA WELCH: When we first got to <Prescott>....

IZORA RALSTON: Her first year of school was right on the Verde.

ZETTA WELCH: I just barely remember goin' to <Prescott>. We lived at the fairgrounds.

IZORA RALSTON: Didn't stay in <Prescott> very long.

ZETTA WELCH: We lived under the bleachers. (laughs)

IZORA RALSTON: Maybe a month or so.

ZETTA WELCH: There wasn't any buildings there, just one big ol’ building, see, and they had these bleachers for the rodeos, what they DID have. And they had horse races in there. (both talking at once, neither discernable)

IZORA RALSTON: You ever know the Jordans down here on the Verde?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: I've HEARD of them.

IZORA RALSTON: Well, you know, they were great farmers. But their dad was from <New Jersey>. But their mother was my husband's aunt. I went to school with THOSE kids up there, too, on the Upper Verde.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh-huh, you were in high school? No?

IZORA RALSTON: No, I didn't get that far. We never had a chance. No, I didn't get as far as high school - I think about the eighth. Then we come from there down to MIDDLE Verde.

ZETTA WELCH: Had to go to school like we did, they'd never get there.

IZORA RALSTON: We had all kinds of schools.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, you moved around a lot. Well, what was the school situation like in the Middle Verde?

ZETTA WELCH: Just one room.

IZORA RALSTON: All grades mixed up.

ZETTA WELCH: I don't know how many pupils they had - perhaps around fifteen or twenty, somethin' like that - just from the farms around in the area. That's about the way the school was, just a little old country school, and the big ol' bell up there.

IZORA RALSTON: Probably eighth, ninth grade.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Who was your teacher then? You just had one teacher?

IZORA RALSTON: Well, Louise Switzer was MY teacher one time. And Mr. Coleson taught school down in Middle Verde. Somebody said Louise Switzer died.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: I don't know.

IZORA RALSTON: I saw her once since I come up here to Flag, but someone told me she died. She was livin' in <California> then.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was she strict as a teacher?

IZORA RALSTON: In a way, yes. You know, they have to be, more or less.

ZETTA WELCH: Well, she catered to the people that had the most money.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh! (chuckles)

IZORA RALSTON: She was nice to me, though. It was after we both quit school, I guess, I met her a time or two.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What other teachers did you have, Mrs. Welch?

ZETTA WELCH: Oh, I had a BUNCH of 'em. (laughs) You mean at <Camp Verde>?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh-huh.

ZETTA WELCH: Oh, Miss Watkins and Miss.... Oh, there’s so darned many, I've forgot 'em all. Miss Riordan.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Miss Riordan?

ZETTA WELCH: Riordan. She was the best teacher I ever had. She married a fellah by the name of Don Vail [phonetic spelling].

IZORA RALSTON: Is that the one that married Don Vail?

ZETTA WELCH: Yeah.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Don't they live in the <Sedona> area now?

ZETTA WELCH: No, they're all dead. They lived just right close to us. We lived across the river from <Camp Verde>, close to the river, the Vails were the next farmers. My dad had this other farm… and Richards - that's just about all the people there was IN there. Warrens, the Warren place. That's about all there was there at that time. And Miss Riordan was the teacher THERE, at that little ol' white schoolhouse down at the Diamond "S" Ranch, way down across the river.

IZORA RALSTON: I think the older generation would know the Ralstons. My husband was a cattleman. He had the first bunch of cattle. Babbitts put up the money for him - him and his brother. That was when my second baby was just a little baby, about 1908, '09, in there.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: When you were going to school, did you have to walk?

IZORA RALSTON: Oh, yes.

ZETTA WELCH: About two miles.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Two miles?

IZORA RALSTON: Yeah.

ZETTA WELCH: We sure did! You got up early, I tell you, with the chickens (chuckles) to get to school. And dark when you got back. When you got back, you had to do all the farmwork.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What kind of chores did you have to do?

ZETTA WELCH: Oh, milkin', feedin' the chickens and pigs and cows and everything - horses, chickens. Water the gardens and bring in the vegetables for the next day and prepare 'em at night for the next day. Yeah.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What kind of a farm did your father have?

ZETTA WELCH: Oh, he was just a general farmer, you know, like vegetables and hay. It was for your own personal living. Otherwise, they didn't farm like they do now, and sell… (both talking at once, neither discernable)

IZORA RALSTON: Yeah, _______________. Got itchy feet.

ZETTA WELCH: Everybody canned and dried their fruit and everything, you know. So that's the general farming WE had, just our living. We'd take corn, Mother would make hominy for the winter and all that stuff.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You didn't sell anything at all then?

ZETTA WELCH: Well, once in a while he'd sell watermelons and cantaloupes, something like that.

IZORA RALSTON: He give most of 'em away.

ZETTA WELCH: Most of 'em he'd take somewhere ______________.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did he ever have to do any other kind of work to support the family?

ZETTA WELCH: Well, my dad was the constable in <Camp Verde> for, let's see.... Oh, my, we left there in 1917 when the war - to go to work at <Clarkdale> at that smelter up there. He was constable while we were here. I was practically raised right there. I was about fifteen, sixteen.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: When you moved to <Clarkdale>?

ZETTA WELCH: (inaudible)

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh-huh. What was it like in <Clarkdale> then? Were you married by that time?

IZORA RALSTON: I didn't live in <Clarkdale>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You didn't?

IZORA RALSTON: Unt-uh. I lived in Clemenceau.

ZETTA WELCH: Better tell her about your weddin' __________. She was married in <Arkansas>, 1905.

IZORA RALSTON: After my husband passed away. We had a little ranch about, oh, five or six miles out in back of the smelter - cattle outfit.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was your husband's first name?

IZORA RALSTON: Roy.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Tell me how you met him.

IZORA RALSTON: I met him right there on Little Verde. We went together - my God, we _________ really had gone with steady. We went together about a year before we was married.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you have a wedding?

IZORA RALSTON: Yes.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Tell me about that.

IZORA RALSTON: Well, that was in the old schoolhouse where both of us had gone to school, and a Baptist minister performed the ceremony. His name was Keene.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you move onto a ranch after you were married?

IZORA RALSTON: Well, yes. The Ralstons owned a ranch down the Verde, the boys did. We lived there, oh, gosh, 'til my oldest boy was about five, six, getting near school age. And then we moved out to <Dewey>. You know where <Dewey> is?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: No.

IZORA RALSTON: Well, we had a bunch of cattle out there on a place they called the Bottle Ranch - the cattle were branded with a bottle. I don't know what the old man was, whether he was an Italian or what he was - but anyway, we bought from him. When the boys had to go to school, we moved into <Dewey>, lived there for a while. Then we sold the Bottle Ranch. Where'd we go next?

ZETTA WELCH: I remember the year you got married. I tell ya', we had one big _________.

IZORA RALSTON: We always had cattle there on the river, though - the boys did, you know. The Mar people lived there, and there was two brothers, and one had the Bar JH; one had the JM Bars. And MY husband and his brother bought the JM Bars. So finally I got tired of livin' around relatives, and I said, "We either move or else!" We moved up on Cherry Creek. We bought a bunch of cattle up there. The last time I saw that old house, you could see daylight around the porch and the house.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: How old were you when you got married?

IZORA RALSTON: Well, I was married in December and I was seventeen in March.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Real young!

IZORA RALSTON: I was pretty young.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: How many children did you have?

IZORA RALSTON: I just had three. I lost my oldest son here a while back. (pause) We're the black sheep of the Ralston family, you know.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, you are?! Tell me about that. (laughs)

IZORA RALSTON: I don't know what was the matter with them - a lot of jealousy, things like that. My husband was a good cattleman, and they just kinda griped, some of 'em. When I made him move out, it was all of them partners, you know. I made him move out, I said, "I'm not gonna take no more of THIS." And they never did like me no more. (laughter) I've been a black sheep ever since.

ZETTA WELCH: We lived all over that place.

IZORA RALSTON: 'Cause none of them boys are livin'. In fact, there's none of 'em livin'. There was seven of those boys and two girls, and they're all dead.

ZETTA WELCH: There's Upper Verde, Lower Verde, Middle Verde, and <Camp Verde>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Could you name me some of the towns that you connect with those places? Like what's in the Upper Verde?

ZETTA WELCH: The surroundings?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, in Upper Verde, what was there at the time?

ZETTA WELCH: Well, <Jerome> was the closest place. (both talking at once, neither discernable)

ZETTA WELCH: ... the cities of <Clarkdale> and down at <Cottonwood>. They used to call it Clemenceau - they changed it, and now I don't now WHAT they call it. Smelter City, I guess, out there were the smelter was, they moved that all away. Now they're building quite a town out there. That was just a little ol' mining town.

IZORA RALSTON: You probably don't remember when the smelter shut down.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Unt-uh.

IZORA RALSTON: Probably before you were born.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Right, so why don't you tell me about that? That's when you first moved up, was when your father was working in the smelter?

ZETTA WELCH: That's when my dad was watchman there for ten years, at Clemenceau. We lived in and out of <Camp Verde> on different places all over the <Verde Valley>. We didn't stay just in one place. The first car I ever saw or heard was her husband bought it, a 1913 Buick. And I had never ridden in a car of no kind. I just either walked or we rode a-horseback, or went in a wagon or a buggy. My mother had a special buggy horse we used, and I'd drive for her. When we'd have to go shoppin', I'd take her shoppin'.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Where did you go shopping?

ZETTA WELCH: <Camp Verde>. It's as farthest as we ever got off the farm.

IZORA RALSTON: __________ that store __________.

ZETTA WELCH: Green Fields? …only merchant that was there. Didn't have any drugstores, we didn't have any doctors, we didn't have anything like that. We lived up on the farm.... Well, the schoolhouse was above the farm. We lived there, and my dad was sick there - he got typhoid fever comin' across the mountains from <Tonto Basin> into <Camp Verde>. And he got sick on the road, and the nearest doctor that you could get to was twenty-five miles. So my brother had to ride twenty-five miles horseback to get a doctor. That's why I told you I'd never seen a doctor. I didn't know what one was. We never HAD a doctor. My mother was doctor and nurse, she took care of her family. We were a healthy bunch, we all lived. We didn't know nothin' about a doctor. We didn't have store-bought candy 'til I was halfway grown. My mother always made it. We was talkin' about that yesterday. We didn't know what candy looked like out of the store. In fact, the kids didn't go to the store, the old folks went. We stayed home. They didn't take the kids to the store very often.

IZORA RALSTON: That was better days than now, huh? You know, you could live cheaper. Now, my goodness, cost of livin’ just out of sight.

ZETTA WELCH: And we was a lot happier than we are now, I'll tell ya'. We didn't worry too much about nothin'. We had enough to eat, and didn't suffer. We had clothes. One thing we had to do, I'll tell you that for sure, went barefoot all summer. Get a pair of shoes when school started, and that's all you got for that year. You didn't GET any more. And your clothes, your mother made for you to WEAR to school. You didn't get any more of THOSE either. You took care of 'em, I'll tell you that. Sure didn't wear 'em out and say, "Well, I don't like 'em," and pitch it away today. You took care of what you had. Take a lunch in a lard bucket about that big with a biscuit and a piece of meat, and maybe it wasn't fruit. I figured we was a healthy bunch and it didn't hurt _____________ few miles mesquite bushes, you couldn’t see above the tops of. Now, that's part of <Tonto Basin>, I lived. The Indians wasn't very doggone friendly, I want to tell ya'.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, tell me about that, more.

ZETTA WELCH: They wouldn't, didn’t have anything to do with white people. When they started to build that dam in there, they moved the Indians out and put 'em on the reservation. I don't know where they sent some of 'em. Some of 'em was put on the reservation around the Verde somewhere, I think. They sure wasn't very friendly, they didn’t have anything to do with the white people. We used to be kinda scared of 'em. Have you read anything about that old Geronimo?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: A little bit.

ZETTA WELCH: Oh, boy! ___________. And everybody was really watching that boy. He didn't settle down for a long time. They'd get drunk. They made their own liquor, they made it out of this mescal out in the hills. They'd get drunk on that and dance all night long and whoop and yell. They had never gone to school, anybody??? the Indians I knew of.

IZORA RALSTON: There were still soldiers in <Camp Verde> when the Ralstons moved there on the Verde. Mother Ralston used to tell me about the Indians coming up there and they'd be scared to death of 'em, you know. Everybody was afraid of Indians in THOSE days. She was tellin' me one story about....

[END TAPE 1, SIDE 1; BEGIN TAPE 1, SIDE 2]

IZORA RALSTON: ... helpin' a man with his sheep, so we'd get enough money to go on. You know, people used to travel like that… stop someplace and work a while and then go on.

Oh, boy, I'll never forget how scared we was THAT day! We thought we was dead! (laughs)

KRISTINE PRENNACE: They didn't DO anything?

IZORA RALSTON: Nah. They were civilized. But that tickled them. They went on over to this camp, and my dad was there. This old man had sheep, you know, and my brother was herdin' those sheep for him. He said, "Did you pass the camp over there where there's a woman and some children?" And they said, "Yes." And he said, "Were they scared?" And they said, "I think maybe so." (laughter) They had nice horses and saddles. They just got up and come in and ate all those cookies! (laughs) You know, I think some <Texas> people ______ about those things. They know nothing about Indians. We have relatives back in <Texas> yet. We don't ever hear from 'em, but some of 'em have been out here to see us a time or two. They've never seen any Indians either. (laughs)

ZETTA WELCH: The first time I ever come up to <Flagstaff>, my sister was workin' up here somewhere and she was sick. So we were livin' in <Phoenix> then. And that was a very bad, cold year. And I had never been to <Flagstaff>. So they sent for my mother to come up, and we come up from <Phoenix> and there had come a big snow and it was ice. They didn't have any sidewalks at all - I guess you'd walk on boards. My sister lived WAY out there, out of <Flagstaff>, where the airport is. That used to be the slaughter pen out there, and her husband did all the butcherin' out there. So that's what I knew about that part of <Flagstaff>, walkin' down that sidewalk, "creak, creak," goin' down there, goin' out to her house. And I thought, "My goodness!" There wasn't any pavement anywhere. All the wagon roads, nine times out of ten you'd bog down before you got where you wanted to go anyway. So the wagons would bog down.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What year was that when you first came up here? Very young?

ZETTA WELCH: I was just a kid, just runnin' around, cared for nothin', I guess.

IZORA RALSTON: About 1909 or somewhere around there.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You came up again by buggy?

ZETTA WELCH: No, we come on the train. We DID have trains. We didn't have any buses or any stages or any way you could come outside of you furnished your own transportation. That's the only way you got here.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What route did the train take from <Phoenix>?

ZETTA WELCH: Well, it come up through <Prescott> and the [Iron Spring?] country over there. Come up the mountain through <Ash Fork> and Williams. That's how we got here.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was the train like then, the passenger part?

ZETTA WELCH: Oh, you've seen them in pictures havn’t you? What they looked like.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: The solid seats, they didn't recline at all.

IZORA RALSTON: Well, they probably had maybe a couple of passenger - a baggage car and then just a regular place for people to ride. I think that's all they had on 'em, and a caboose. They had the caboose.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you stop at the Harvey House in <Ash Fork>? Do you remember that?

ZETTA WELCH: Perhaps they stopped there for a little while to change trains, as the trains come in. I don't think there's very many come in here, that I can remember of.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: How long did the trip take?

ZETTA WELCH: I think we was on there a day and a night, __________, yeah. A day and a night.

IZORA RALSTON: Where'd you take a train from, Zetta?

ZETTA WELCH: You were down in <Phoenix>, wouldn’t you…

IZORA RALSTON: Yeah.

ZETTA WELCH: Not when we come up here. My Molly was sick up here. Anyway, we come on a train.

IZORA RALSTON: Well, I remember WE come up to <Flagstaff> ________. (both talking at once, neither discernable) from <Jerome>.

ZETTA WELCH: You couldn't leave it from <Jerome> - you had to go to <Prescott>.

IZORA RALSTON: I don't remember where you was livin', even.

ZETTA WELCH: Well, I do, because there wasn't any other way to get here. Wasn't any trains anywhere else.

IZORA RALSTON: Funny how you forget things.

ZETTA WELCH: So I KNOW that's where we went, we went to <Prescott> and then come to <Flagstaff>.

IZORA RALSTON: Could have been. (laughs)

ZETTA WELCH: We come up through Williams, got to <Ash Fork>, and then on up here.

IZORA RALSTON: I thought that Papa had a wagon and team then. I know he went BACK up there after Mama with a wagon.

ZETTA WELCH: Well, he mighta come up here and got us, I don't know. I don't remember going back on the train. Lee met us up there in town.

IZORA RALSTON: Who?

ZETTA WELCH: Lee met us when we got off of the train, and took us up to the house. That's how I remember the board walk __________.

IZORA RALSTON: You can't imagine how people can live out like that and be so ignorant, can you?! Golly, we didn't know nothin' or nobody hardly.

ZETTA WELCH: I didn't figure I was ignorant. (laughs) A lot of things I didn't know, I guess.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: It was snow up here, and what… did he pick you up with the buckboard to take you back?

ZETTA WELCH: No, walked.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You walked all the way out to where the airport is now?

ZETTA WELCH: Yes, ma'am, out this way, where the butcher pen, the old slaughter pen was. It's out that way isn't it? Where the old slaughter pen is? South of <Flagstaff>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Originally you said it was out by the airport, where the airport is now.

ZETTA WELCH: That would be south.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, right. You walked all that way?!

ZETTA WELCH: Yes, ma'am. ________ see the train come in early in the mornin', I THINK. It was still dark, I remember that. And he met us and carried the suitcases. Didn't have any other way to get out, just walked out.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: In the snow?

ZETTA WELCH: I remember those sidewalks. I don't know too much about <Flagstaff>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Didn't have to come back into town to get supplies or anything? (no audible response) You just went out and stayed out there?

ZETTA WELCH: Probably her husband did.

IZORA RALSTON: My sister had to trade with Babbitts', you know. They were the only store here then.

ZETTA WELCH: He probably done all the shoppin'. I don't remember HER goin' shoppin'. She never went shoppin' with him nowhere - he all done the shopping.

IZORA RALSTON: Who?

ZETTA WELCH: Lee.

IZORA RALSTON: She and I were in Babbitts' Store when I was up here several times.

ZETTA WELCH: She didn't do much shoppin' I know - he done all that.

IZORA RALSTON: Well, she was more ignorant than we were!

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was Babbitts' like when you came up?

IZORA RALSTON: Well, I think they've got the same store there, but its…

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember the inside, what it was like?

IZORA RALSTON: Nice inside.

ZETTA WELCH: It was just a country store, that's all.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: They carried everything?

ZETTA WELCH: Everything: hardware....

IZORA RALSTON: They had a pretty dress in the window, and I coaxed my sister to buy it. I finally got her to buy it (laughs) so she'd have somethin' nice to wear.

ZETTA WELCH: It was mostly cattle and sheep, you see, and they took care of the cow men and sheep men. So it was just a general store is what it was called, that's all. Wasn't like a department store, where you buy Levis and boots and stuff like that.

IZORA RALSTON: Babbitts' would stake most of the cattlemen here in this country.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You were going to tell me about that before. Was it your husband that he staked?

IZORA RALSTON: Uh-huh. He put up the money. I had to go down when they bought their first - they already had SOME cattle, you know. Of course they put their cattle up for security, and the Babbitts put up the rest of the money. But can you imagine, they got that bunch of cattle for $10,000. You couldn't buy it for that now.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: How many head of cattle were there?

IZORA RALSTON: I don't really know. But it was an old bunch and an old brand. Of course you probably don't know anything about the cattle business, but it was an old brand, 'cause those two brothers had come in there and built the two brands up, you know: the JM Bars and the Bar JHs. And my husband went to work for the JM Bars when he was about sixteen, and he worked up until we were married, and he was twenty-four then. Old Uncle Joe had said you had to marry a man that _______ work. My husband was doin' all the work, and Uncle Joe, he was watchin'. And he said he'd never hire another married man. When Roy got married, well, he quit - quit workin' for him. They always called my husband "Kip." And he asked Dad Ralston one time, "What happened to Kip?" And my dad said, "Well, you know he got married." "Well," he said, "he didn't have to quit." (laughs) And he never did work for __________ any more after that, run his own cattle.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you meet the Babbitts ever?

ZETTA WELCH: No, I never have met the Babbitts myself, but they're old-time people here, you know. They've been here for YEARS, I guess. Financed a lot of people. I'll tell you this, Mr. Bilby, he's the brother-in-law to Babbitts. I worked with his daughter over in the delicatessen over here (laughs) and boy, she was nice. I liked her. We had more fun! I forgot what her name was. Maybe you know, went to school with her.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: I don't know.

IZORA RALSTON: I think they're still out here, but I haven't seen HER. I believe her name was Joann - somethin' like that.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Is that Ralph Bilby?

ZETTA WELCH: That was Ralph Bilby's daughter. We used to have more fun!

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay.... (tape turned off and on)

IZORA RALSTON: I think she took a nurse's course and she's a graduate nurse now.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well, we haven't talked much about Mrs. Welch's marriage and who she married and all that. So why don't you tell me that?

ZETTA WELCH: Well, I met my husband in <Cottonwood>, and I went with him for quite a while, I guess. In 1922 I got married. I was married there. I was nineteen years old.

IZORA RALSTON: That was in the twenties, wasn't it, Ze?

ZETTA WELCH: Nineteen twenty-two.

IZORA RALSTON: I know it was in the twenties, anyway.

ZETTA WELCH: Dad left <Camp Verde> in 1918. I was single a long time, I'll tell ya'.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: A long time? You were married at nineteen! (laughs)

ZETTA WELCH: So I got married in 1922.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was his name?

ZETTA WELCH: His name was William Welch. He was raised in <Prescott>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What did he do?

ZETTA WELCH: You mean after he grew up? (laughs)

KRISTINE PRENNACE: (laughs) Yeah, we can start there.

ZETTA WELCH: Well, he was a stone mason. He used to do quite a bit of stonework right here. He was considered one of the best in the state. He did a lot of the work around in this country. We camped out here at Kit Carson one time during the Depression. You couldn't get any work, you couldn't get anything to eat, you couldn't get nothin'. So he got a job with the dudes, shoein' horses. He had ten head of horses he had to shoe, for a dollar-and-a-half a day. (chuckles) That’s every cent he got. So that's what we had to live. We stayed out there in that campgrounds. I know that much about <Flagstaff>. You couldn't get a day's work nowhere. Hardly even get a loaf of bread. You couldn't even get enough to BUY a loaf of bread. So he worked for that dude outfit, shoein' horses.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you have children at that time?

ZETTA WELCH: I never had but one.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You had come up from <Cottonwood> to <Flagstaff>?

ZETTA WELCH: Yeah, used to come up here, but you had cars then - didn't have to come in wagons.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Right. But you came looking for work up here?

ZETTA WELCH: Oh, you'd just go anyplace you can, where you might think you could pick up a day or two of work.

IZORA RALSTON: That was during the Depression.

ZETTA WELCH: My God, we went to <California>, and you couldn't get nothin' over there. So we went through <Las Vegas>, and he got there, well, they'd give you ten days' work up there to get you out of town, and give you enough gas to go on, so they did that. He couldn't find nothin' over there either. We picked up a dollar or two somewhere, I don't know where, and said, "We'll go back home." So we started back home. We had one potato and ten cents (laughs) is all we had. We stopped out in the desert to eat that potato, and we come on back into <Phoenix>. You just couldn't get a day's work nowhere. They wouldn't even look at you, or talk with you about it. We got back there, and then we moved into <Dewey Arizona>. And we lived there a long time, and then we went to <Prescott>. We lived there for several years. That's where my daughter was born. And then we come back out to <Dewey>. We built our home out there, and he worked in that old Iron King Mine there for eleven years. He died there in '59 with a heart attack. That was just about the end of my marriage. But I had a nice time while I WAS married. I have no regrets. He was just like that. Where he went, I went. We just good kids together, I guess.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was the Depression like for a rancher? Were you ranching at that time?

IZORA RALSTON: No. I took work around wherever I could get somethin' to make a dollar or two a day. It was in <Prescott> then. No, we lost our cattle outfit. After my husband died his brothers come in and took it over, set us out flat.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well, when did your husband die?

IZORA RALSTON: He died in '27.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, that was before. But you were on your own then pretty much?

IZORA RALSTON: I was alone, I had to scratch around any way I could to make a livin', and I had a little ten-year-old boy. My son worked in the smelter there. We lived with him for a while. Then when he got married, well, we had to go out on our own, you know. I'll tell you right now, we didn’t live too easy, but we didn’t starve.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What kind of jobs did you do?

IZORA RALSTON: Well, I worked in people's homes, and around like that, you know - maybe make five dollars a week, and kept us somethin' to eat. Then finally I got into the maid work, hotels. _____________. I worked at Fort Whipple for about a year-and-a-half, too. But things were gettin' better then, you know. There was still a Depression on. I run that Chino Valley School a couple of years. I worked out there. That was a nice place to work, though. That's what started me out, though. When I got out there I realized I could do better, so I just _______. (both talking at once, neither discernable) _________ before in my life, didn't know nothin' about it.

ZETTA WELCH: _________ once in a while, if you had children. But if you didn't have any children, you could move in with the rest of 'em. You didn't get nothin' on that.

IZORA RALSTON: I finally signed, you know, when they had the three "C's" [Civilian Conservation Corps], I finally signed my son up in the CC's, and then I was loose then, so I could take a job away from home. As long as he was home, I couldn't leave home. He was tellin' me the other day, "Mama, it's the best thing you ever done for me."

KRISTINE PRENNACE: That's nice.

IZORA RALSTON: He got along fine out there, too.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did they work, or just take care of 'em?

IZORA RALSTON: Yeah.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What did they do?

IZORA RALSTON: Oh, I think they planted trees, and oh, there's different jobs. But anyway, they got somethin' to eat. There was a lot of those boys there, you know. I couldn't go away and leave him, because he wouldn't have nothin' to live on. So I could get a job, but I had to go away from home to get it. I got tired of that, so I just signed him up. And I went out into a mining camp and cooked for a bunch of guys out there for about thirteen months. I only got forty dollars a month for that, and board.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was the mining camp like?

IZORA RALSTON: Oh, I think it was a bunch of guys that was just out from <Los Angeles>, and some rich guy put up the money for 'em, and they thought it was a gold mine. They never had a grain of gold out of it. But still, it was a good place to work. I stayed out there about a year, a little over a year. I was kind of glad to get back in town, though, get a place and live by myself. They were nice guys, all of 'em were real nice men. They were all college graduates. They really were nice. They wouldn't let me go to town with one of the muckers, mine muckers. The boss said to me, "Don't you NEVER go to town with one of those muckers. If you have to go to town, I'll take you." They was all that way. They sure looked after me like I was a little kid or somethin'. (laughs)

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What were the mine muckers?

IZORA RALSTON: Well, this was, oh, the other side of <Skull Valley>. You know where <Skull Valley> is?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh-huh.

ZETTA WELCH: It is out there someplace.

IZORA RALSTON: They called it the Bland Gold Mine. There was an old poor lady lived out there. Oh! that was pitiful. She married an old guy; she put in an ad, you know, those heart in hand? And he had to be bad. I just got this story from them. And she got out there and she didn't want to stay, and he wouldn't let her go, made her stay there. And you know, that poor old lady was SO dirty. I don't know how in the world she stood it. Her FACE was even dirty. And her hair was just matted. She hadn't combed it for years, I don't think. And her feet were both broken on the instep. They started to go someplace, and he started the horses up just as she got on the wagon wheel. And she was all hunch-backed like this. I never felt so sorry for anybody in my life, as I did for that old lady. But there's a family lived there, had a girl about fifteen or sixteen years old. She just decided she was gonna clean that old lady up. So she went over there and she gave her a bath, and I guess she dug her out some clean clothes from a trunk or something. Now mind you, she was a schoolteacher. She cleaned her all up, give her bath, and then she combed her hair out. And I went down there and the dirt was just (laughing) comin' out from between her fingers. I forget what they called her now, what her name was. But anyway, I called her name, I said, "You know what I'd do to get that to come out of there?, you'd dip the comb in coal oil." And so she did that, so it begin to straighten out, you know. But she took the scissors and she just went right through that like that, and cut it all off. But she was a sweet-lookin' little old thing when she got through with her. I thought about that so much. And I know she was SO lonesome back there. And she couldn't get away from there, because it was MILES away from town.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: It was like a homestead?

IZORA RALSTON: No, it was a mining camp.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: And she worked....

IZORA RALSTON: Her husband had a mine there, and he called it a gold mine, but there wasn't a grain of gold in that thing. And he made her run the hoist. That's what made her hump-backed. The last time I saw that old lady, I was up there in Kingman, and one of these guys, I was with him up there, and he told me, "You know that Mrs. Bland is over there in the hospital?" I said, "Well, I'm gonna go and see her then." So I went over there to see her, and she was so nice and clean, you know, and I said, "My goodness, don't you feel good to be in here?" She said, "Yes, it seems like bein' in heaven." She had great big sores on her legs, and the flies _______. Some of the people that was out there, they went in there and found her, and they took her into Kingman and put her in the hospital. I guess she must have died there. I felt sorry for the old lady. I don't know how she got her food, even. I was thinkin' about that the other day. I wondered how that old lady got her food. SOMEBODY must have took it in there for her. I was out there about thirteen months. Kind of a lonesome place to work. Those fellahs were all young, real nice and see that I had a comfortable place to sleep and things like that.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Mrs. Welch, did you say that your husband or someone had worked in a mining camp?

ZETTA WELCH: Yeah, he worked in that Iron King Mine out there at <Humboldt>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was that like?

IZORA RALSTON: They called it "The Shag" [phonetic spelling] then. They changed the name of it. It was an old original mine that was found there by an old prospector. He sold it for thirty-five dollars, after he discovered it. And that turned out to be really rich. So THAT was the activity at <Humboldt>. That's what kept the town alive. That, and McCabe was the oldest mining town there. Of course their mines all run out, too, and they closed all that down. But they discovered this other one then, so it just kept on going, going like that. And now they closed it down again because they can't work in there anymore - it's too hot or something - so they shut it down. My husband worked there for eleven years in the mill. A mucker is a guy who works underground.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, the ones that actually dig it out.

ZETTA WELCH: Yeah, and pushes it out on the wheelbarrow. They don't have any cars, you know. They didn't have cars then to run it out on, or elevators either. So these guys… that's what they were called, muckers.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh-huh. What did your husband do in the mill, what was his job?

ZETTA WELCH: Well, he was the manager of the mill. They had to mix this cyanide and stuff and all, that they used to separate.... It was used in the ore somehow. And that's what he did. He was takin' care of that. So I____________, probably had he been here if he weren’t workin' in that cyanide mill. There's three fellahs died there that day, that worked in that mill, just the same way he did. And that's what THEY did, they had to run that mill _________. There's what they call a crusher - they crushed the ore is what they did. And then they used this cyanide for chemical purposes - I don't know, I never asked him.

IZORA RALSTON: All those mine smelters used cyanide.

ZETTA WELCH: Yeah, after the mine closed down.

IZORA RALSTON: Those men get it in their lungs, too.

ZETTA WELCH: He was still working there when he died.

IZORA RALSTON: Oh.

ZETTA WELCH: Closed down after that. And I wasn’t old enough for Social Security, or anything. I didn’t have much to look forward to, either.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What did you do then to support yourself?

IZORA RALSTON: I didn't do anything, I just… housework. I never worked there.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well, how did you support yourself?

ZETTA WELCH: I had SOME insurance. Of course he was insured. So I made it for a couple of years that way. Now I draw his Social Security, that's why I live. He wouldn't hear of me about goin' off someplace and goin' to work. That's why I just never worked out. And she was more experienced, to get by that way. But you gotta have experience to know how to get out and do it. Never did work out in my life. I don't think I would want to _______. (laughter) It's hard to work for the public.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah. Let's go back a little bit to World War I. What do you remember about that time?

ZETTA WELCH: Me?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Either one. World War I, what do you remember about it?

IZORA RALSTON: Oh, yeah. Well, we didn't have any - yes, we did too, we had some nephews in it.

ZETTA WELCH: I guess all of them.

IZORA RALSTON: None of our brothers had to go.

ZETTA WELCH: That's the year that they had…

IZORA RALSTON: My brother's three boys was in that.

ZETTA WELCH: Remember that? Heard about that?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: The flu epidemic? Okay, tell me about that then.

ZETTA WELCH: Thousands of people died of that. We had one brother die with it. All the rest of us had it.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You actually had the flu?

ZETTA WELCH: We actually had the flu. My mother took care of the whole bunch of us. And she never did take it. I don't know how she escaped. A higher power, I guess. But she was takin' care of all of us, and then she had a TB patient she was takin' care of. My brother was guard up there at the Park there. They had a big strike up there, and he was workin' out there at guard, and he took it, and it seemed, of course, that everybody they sent to the pest house, died. And he died with that.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What kind of treatment did you get? Your mother nursed you and everything, but what did she do to get you over it?

ZETTA WELCH: Well, she used those remedies she used all of her life. She'd get you down and put quinine and stuff on you. Give you quinine water and stuff like that for blood poisoning. She broke many a case of blood poisoning.

IZORA RALSTON: All the old-timers had the old remedies, you know.

ZETTA WELCH: Then we used to rub - they'd take and make a poultice out of corn meal and onions - mustard plasters - and put on. That broke the pneumonia. Many and many a case of pneumonia was broken with just mustard plaster, that's all.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: 'Cause you did all that when you had the flu?

ZETTA WELCH: We did, and we all got well.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: But you were married at that time?

IZORA RALSTON: Oh, yeah.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you get the flu?

IZORA RALSTON: __________ three children.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did any of them get ill with the flu?

IZORA RALSTON: Oh, yeah, we all had it, but we come through it all right.

ZETTA WELCH: ___________.

IZORA RALSTON: I don't think I had it, I think my nerves kinda went to pieces when my brother died.

ZETTA WELCH: She had her family....

IZORA RALSTON: The rest of 'em had it, though.

ZETTA WELCH: I had people come in my house to stay when they… if somebody else had the flu, they'd come stay with you to get away from the rest of the people so THEY wouldn't have it. I had MY house full too, all down there all at one time. My mother was takin' care of that whole bunch.

IZORA RALSTON: We was livin' in <Camp Verde> then.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh-huh.

ZETTA WELCH: That was pretty rough flu, the worst I ever had, though.... [END TAPE I, SIDE 2; BEGIN TAPE 2, SIDE 1]

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What did you call that where your brother was? The pest house?

ZETTA WELCH: They took him to, they called it a pest house, yeah. The worst patients, they just ran them in there. They couldn't put everybody in there.

IZORA RALSTON: You see, they had to close the schools, so they just made a pest house out of the schoolhouses. (both talking at once, neither discernable)

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh-huh.

ZETTA WELCH: And after that, they had a smallpox epidemic.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: When was that?

ZETTA WELCH: Right after that.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you all get smallpox?

IZORA RALSTON: [Swetly?] had it.

ZETTA WELCH: I never did have it.

IZORA RALSTON: That's when we lived in <Fort McDowell>, though. And the Mexicans brought it in there. There was more Mexicans up there than there were white people, you know, and of course everybody mixed. They'd have their big celebrations and things. That's the way WE got 'em.

ZETTA WELCH: Blacks caught 'em, and they're the worst thing.

IZORA RALSTON: You know what the Mexicans would do for that?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What?

IZORA RALSTON: They'd get all broke out and rub ashes on 'em, dry it up. And they'd just keep goin', so they'd just spread it all over the place. I remember the doctor come out there (chuckles) from <Tempe> and he vaccinated everybody. And we'd already had it in our system when he vaccinated us, so we all had it.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: How did they vaccinate for smallpox then?

IZORA RALSTON: The same.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did they cut with glass?

IZORA RALSTON: They just made a place down there right below my knee. I'll never forget that. The ol' doctor said - he made me mad at him - said, "Now you got a clean spot!" he said. (laughs) _____________. I try to be clean! (laughs) He was just a rough talker, he didn't mean anything by it.

ZETTA WELCH: Mine didn't take, either one - didn't have the smallpox or the vaccination didn't take. Didn't bother me.

IZORA RALSTON: Well, it was VERY long after he vaccinated all of us, we all come down with it. I never did break out very bad, but my mother was just a solid sore, her whole body.

ZETTA WELCH: I never had the measles 'til I growed up. I never had whooping cough, I never had measles, I never had any of the child[hood] ailments. Needed to grow up, I guess.

IZORA RALSTON: I don't think anybody died with it, though. I can't remember, might have been some of the Mexicans might have.

ZETTA WELCH: Oh, I bet they did.

IZORA RALSTON: I don't think there were very many people. Was off way up there where they didn't have any doctor.

ZETTA WELCH: I had to take care of my own kids. I took the darned chicken pox from HER. She got the chicken pox at school, and I got the darned chicken pox, they all laughed like everything 'cause I got chicken pox.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any droughts?

ZETTA WELCH: Oh, man, '29.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: In '29?

IZORA RALSTON: Drought?

ZETTA WELCH: The year of that drought, when all of our cattle died and everything.

IZORA RALSTON: Oh, yeah, when the cattle died.

ZETTA WELCH: Just take and get a bulldozer and shove 'em up.

IZORA RALSTON: No feed, no water. Oh, it was terrible.

ZETTA WELCH: Push 'em off a bank, you know. Just pile up the cattle. Then they burned it.

IZORA RALSTON: Along about 1904, I think. Before I was married.

ZETTA WELCH: They were workin' at WPA, 'cause we were livin' at [Peter?], and Bill had a bunch of men down there, workin', way out there close to Crown King.

IZORA RALSTON: That wasn't durin' the drought, though.

ZETTA WELCH: That was during the Depression, and the drought right along with it.

IZORA RALSTON: I don't think I'll ever forget that Depression.

ZETTA WELCH: They go up there and burn those cattle, and you can smell 'em for miles, you know, burn them up.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: How did you get drinking water then?

ZETTA WELCH: Well, they had wells - people did, you know.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: But they just didn't have enough to graze the cattle on?

ZETTA WELCH: Oh, no! This was just dry country. Even the pines all turned brown. They weren't pretty to me then. There wasn't any grass anywhere. The cattle just starved to death. Go by and see some old cow standin' out there, just reelin' like that, just ready to fall.

IZORA RALSTON: No water and no feed, you know. Ralstons fed a lot of their cattle.

ZETTA WELCH: A lot of the game starved to death.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were there a lot of fires?

ZETTA WELCH: They had quite a few fires that year, yeah. They had a lot of boys to handle it, too. Them CC kids, they was workin' ________. They had a bunch of 'em up there in Crown King, big recreation ground over there caught fire, burned acres and acres of land. That was a dry year.

IZORA RALSTON: You know, some of those old cows would get down and couldn't get up, they'd be so weak. Sure lost a lot of 'em.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was there a lot of snow where you were living?

ZETTA WELCH: Yeah, there was snow, ____ quite a bit of it. You mean <Prescott>?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah. Well, in that area.

ZETTA WELCH: At <Camp Verde>, I walked in the snow this deep.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, really?!

ZETTA WELCH: You wouldn't believe it, but you did.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What year was that, do you remember?

ZETTA WELCH: Oh, 1915, around then.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, the big snow then, yeah.

ZETTA WELCH: Walk out there and it would strike you right up there. The year she was married was a big snow too. Yeah, 1920.

IZORA RALSTON: Didn't stay on the ground long, though.

ZETTA WELCH: We was talkin' the other day about those people buyin' up all that land down there. They don't know what's doin' sometimes, I don't think - but WE do. I wouldn't buy a place there, they couldn't give it to me, the deed and paid for it.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: At <Camp Verde>?

ZETTA WELCH: Up across. You know, goin' up across that valley there, close to the bridge where it crosses the river.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, yeah.

ZETTA WELCH: They don't know what they got there.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Floods?

ZETTA WELCH: No foolin'! I've seen the river get up and last for three months before you can even THINK about crossin' it, anywhere. You just…

IZORA RALSTON: The first part of 1905, the Ralstons home place was right along the bank of the river. The schoolhouse… you can see they're movin' over there, you know, and they had to tear that old house down and MOVE. Washed their pigs down the river, and their chickens.

ZETTA WELCH: All their stuff.

IZORA RALSTON: And it was about to get their house, and they had to move. You just see them workin' like everything over there. (laughs) From the schoolhouse.

ZETTA WELCH: I see those people have bought right on the brink of that down there. You know, cross over on the other side over there. Someday they MIGHT see that again, I don't know. But that's the way it was when WE lived in the Verde. In the wintertime, you didn't cross the river.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: It was in the winter it ran so bad?

ZETTA WELCH: Yeah. Wintertime you just couldn't hardly cross that river. Maybe two and three months, ___________.

IZORA RALSTON: You know, those kids used to swim that river, with the horses.

ZETTA WELCH: ________ <Camp Verde>, the boys I had - I had five brothers. ________ take a notion you want to go someplace. Saddle up my horse and take off. And we used to run that river several times on horseback. The water run up over your saddle - just to go to a party. ______ kids, see. I wouldn't do it now.

IZORA RALSTON: I'm sure scared of water.

ZETTA WELCH: Well, we had good horses, good swimmers.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you each have a horse?

ZETTA WELCH: Yeah, everybody had a horse. That's what happened when we came from <Tonto Basin> over here, into the Verde. We got there, the river was up, and we couldn't cross it. They hadn't been crossing at all. And we camped there by a place, some people lived there. We had to stay there for about four days before we even dared ford that river.

IZORA RALSTON: You'll have to excuse me for a minute. (tape turned off and on)

ZETTA WELCH: I say every once in a while I'm not gonna drink anymore, but I still find myself a drinkin’.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What kind of social life was there in the community when you were down in <Camp Verde>?

IZORA RALSTON: Dancin'.

ZETTA WELCH: A bunch of us used to get together and go on picnics, and swimmin' and things like that - horseback riding, or hiking, or go to the dances - things. That was our recreation.

IZORA RALSTON: I'm just wondering are all the adobe buildings still settin' up there where we used to always dance so much - had all our dances in that. Then WE kids come up there - you know, <Camp Verde> is awful clanish. Boy, we didn't know they was clanish, we just went ahead and really had a good time. But we was all good dancers then, anything we wanted to, you know. And my brother and I danced an awful lot together. Then I just danced with everybody.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What kind of dance did you do then?

IZORA RALSTON: Well, two-steps and waltz.

ZETTA WELCH: Waltz and.... Well, they started out… then they finally got up to where when they called a rag.... We used to do the [su bien?], which was more of a square dance. You know, like a square dance. But it wasn't exactly the same as a square dance, it's a little different. And they called out the Paul Jones, su bien. Did you ever hear of that one? (

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Unt-uh.) "Put your little foot."

KRISTINE PRENNACE: OH! uh-huh.

ZETTA WELCH: That's what that is. We danced that THOUSANDS of times.

IZORA RALSTON: My brother and I always danced the two-step together, and we didn't know we danced the two-step any different from anybody else. A Mormon guy down in Mesa taught me the two-step, and my brother hadn't ever danced too much, so he said, "Kid" - he always called me kid - he said, "Let's go upstairs and you teach me to do that two-step." I said, "Okay, we'll do that." He harmonica and we danced the floor out, almost, up there. And when we went to <Camp Verde>, you know, they'd stand back and watch us. I would say, “We better quit,” everybody stopped. (laughter) And they'd say, "Where'd you learn to dance that?" We didn't know, we just danced it.

ZETTA WELCH: It's within you, how you dance. You're with the music. And I guess us kids could dance from the time we was big enough to get around and listen to music - and sing and dance. We had a regular orchestra of our own, if we would have gotten together, because all of us was good singers and good dancers. But I don't know, we just didn't develop any of our talent or anything. We all had talent for music, AND singin'. She used to be a good singer. And all my sisters, and my brothers we had one tenor and one bass. The rest of us were all good singers. I don't see why we didn't __________.

IZORA RALSTON: A lot of those people down there, you know, they didn't like to have a new crowd come in there. A lot of the times the boys wouldn't dance with a new girl. _______ dance _______ dance. (laughing while talking obscures comment) We didn't know anything about 'em bein' clanish like that, you know. We went on like we didn't even KNOW anything about it.

ZETTA WELCH: ________ dance, from <Camp Verde>, and take a wagon and put hay in it and hook four horses to it, and the kids would all pile in there, about fifteen or twenty or thirty, and ride that wagon up to <Sedona> - from <Camp Verde> to <Sedona>, to a dance. We'd stay up there, oh, around <Oak Creek>. We'd stay up there all night, and early the next morning, the sun was comin' up, and start back. At the dance, they'd bring cake - the ladies would, you know - and then they'd have a big old can of coffee cookin' out on a campfire - a five-gallon can. Drink coffee all night, and eat cake. That's what they did at the dances.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: It was just out in the open?

ZETTA WELCH: Yeah, out in the open.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was there any development in <Sedona> then? ZW and

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Not much; one store.

ZETTA WELCH: Very scarce. Maybe just scattered, you know, down the river. Used to go over to <Oak Creek>, and that was the same way - just farms. But they used to have celebrations out there on the Fourth of July, big picnics out there.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were there special things that went on, on the Fourth of July?

ZETTA WELCH: Yeah. All kinds of games and horse racin' and like that.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You used to go up to <Sedona> then for the Fourth of July?

ZETTA WELCH: No, we used to come up to - they had it down there at <Camp Verde>. They had a regular track out there. But they DID have rodeos in <Oak Creek>. We went up there lots of times, to rodeos, and they had horse racin' and all kinds of games. Made your own ice cream, your own barbecue. Take the guys four or five days to barbecue a beef for that celebration. And then everybody'd take a big old freezer and everybody'd be turnin' ice cream freezers, and a big ol' barrel of lemonade that big. And you just helped yourself and it didn't cost you nothin'. Didn't cost you no fifteen, ten cents a big glass. Help yourself.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did they have fireworks or firecrackers?

ZETTA WELCH: You betcha! When they got so they HAD 'em. For a long time I didn't know what they was - never seen any. We just had picnics and things like that on the Fourth of July. We used to go to <Prescott> in the early days, you know, when they had the Fourth of July picnics there. They'd shoot firecrackers and stuff all over that town, _________.

IZORA RALSTON: Well, you know, people ____________ now either. A bunch of young people get together, they mixed and had a good time.

ZETTA WELCH: EVERYBODY had a good time.

IZORA RALSTON: Drinkin' ______ didn't pay any attention to it.

ZETTA WELCH: There was no goin' out with a boy and settin' on a doorstep all night long either. You come in the house when you got home! (laughter) The man took you home, he took his hat off, held it in his hands, and said, "Goodnight. Can I have another date for the next dance?" They didn't go to the bushes and hide up here in the rocks someplace, or sit out in some car or some old place, you know, where nobody could see ya'. The man took you home, you went right in the house when you got there. I always had lots of dates. I didn't have to go to the bushes! That's what was so funny to me.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Why?

ZETTA WELCH: Boy, does time change that.

IZORA RALSTON: Young girls in those days wouldn't go OUT with a boy that was drinkin'.

ZETTA WELCH: No, sir.

IZORA RALSTON: And they wouldn't hardly dance with 'em.

ZETTA WELCH: He didn't come in the dance hall, if he had a drink. He never asked a girl to dance. And he didn't take her nowhere either. Folks wouldn't let us go with anybody like that, and my brothers wouldn't. Nope, you can't go with him. _________. (laughter) And I had lots of boyfriends - I mean, just friends, kids.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What were the churches like? Did you used to go to church?

IZORA RALSTON: Usually went to the Baptist church.

ZETTA WELCH: Just one big ________ - I mean, church. I remember when I joined the church, First Southern Baptist. I was about ten or twelve, and I joined the church. The minister's daughter was my best friend. Sweetest girl I ever knew.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was the minister's name?

ZETTA WELCH: Smith, John Smith.

IZORA RALSTON: I had a lot of friends who were Mormon kids, the young people.

ZETTA WELCH: That was at Middle Verde.

IZORA RALSTON: These are nice people up here, the Mormon people up here. Paul Greer - he's a Mormon - he's the manager of the Pony Soldier over here. He's still got me on his payroll. He said, "I want to keep her on there, when she come back." I don't know when that'll be. (laughs)

ZETTA WELCH: The first sermon that was preached here in the Middle Verde, her husband's granddad preached that sermon under a cottonwood tree down in the riverbottom. No old churches then. He preached the first sermon in the <Verde Valley>.

IZORA RALSTON: They used to have nice meetings down there. EVERYBODY 'round the country would come, you know. And preachers come up from <Phoenix>. They really had a nice time, everybody'd take lunch, you know.

ZETTA WELCH: Big revivals.

IZORA RALSTON: I saw the Jordans come up - it's been quite a while ago - and they said they still had 'em down there. I never have been to one down there.

ZETTA WELCH: How come they have 'em down there, when that's the Indian reservation?

IZORA RALSTON: Of course Grandpa Ralston's been dead for a number of years.

ZETTA WELCH: Where we lived is reservation. Our farm went on the reservation, with the Indians.

IZORA RALSTON: Used to be ministers come up from <Phoenix>, and we'd have the nicest revivals down there. Oh! They just really would be good. Picnics outside.

ZETTA WELCH: A lot of people don't believe in__________.

IZORA RALSTON: I don't know what they do down there anymore.

ZETTA WELCH: Goin' to a picnic on Sunday, holy day - well, if you're holy, it doesn't make any difference to me WHEN I go to a picnic, because I don't see any harm in GOIN' to a picnic. I don't think the Lord would hold that against us, just because we went to a picnic on Sunday. That doesn't make you any less holy - not to me.

IZORA RALSTON: You know, people don't get together like that anymore. Here awhile back, my son took us all around.... Where did he take us?

ZETTA WELCH: Huh?

IZORA RALSTON: Where did [we go] that Sunday that [Linford?] took us. And there's people camped all around up in there. They looked like they were just not mixing.

ZETTA WELCH: Cherry Creek, ___________.

IZORA RALSTON: We had to go quite a ways up there to find a place to park.

ZETTA WELCH: They used to go to Cherry Creek, over in that part of the country. Just a little cattle ranch, here and there. Her husband had cattle in there.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What were the christenings and weddings and funerals like in the church? Did you have christenings? (no audible response) No christenings. Weddings and funerals, what were they like?

IZORA RALSTON: Oh, maybe whoever was gettin' married in the family, they'd just have kind of a reception, just amongst the family.

ZETTA WELCH: The girls was married in their own home - didn't have no church or nothin' like that. (both talking at once, neither discernable)

ZETTA WELCH: ___________ by a minister. Just an old country minister, ________ rest of the people. And then have a supper after. They'd have some real nice weddings, too. My sister had a BEAUTIFUL wedding that way in Mesa. I remember just a little bit about that. The first time I ever ate an olive. I said, “Gee Whiz.” (laughter) You have to learn to like 'em.

IZORA RALSTON: We've got a friend down there in <Dewey>. She was tellin' us when her and her husband got married, when the preacher was sayin' the ceremony, you know, he asked her questions, you know, and she said, "I do." And then he turned around and asked her husband, and [Aster?] says, "I do." (laughs) _________ you're not married to me. (laughter)

ZETTA WELCH: She has a piece about that long. My mother told her - she likes these things too - and she's going to print those up, and she's going to send them to me, and I'll let you see them.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Good. That'd be good.

ZETTA WELCH: ___________________.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Uh-huh, or we could just copy it.

ZETTA WELCH: Yeah.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah, that'd be good.

ZETTA WELCH: You can't put nothin' in the paper, 'cause they don't put nothin' in there. I had the awfulest time gettin' anything put in the paper when her son passed away. I just couldn't get nobody to find out how to get it in there or anything. But they do in the Courier. That's in <Prescott>. They put long pieces in there about him. I just got about that much of it. I didn't get in what I wrote. But I think Jeana… maybe you know Jean.

IZORA RALSTON: Uh-huh.

ZETTA WELCH: She got that for me. ___________.

IZORA RALSTON: I'll tell you one thing about the people in <Flagstaff>, though: they're all nice. I've never met a person that was kind of snobbish.

ZETTA WELCH: I think Jean is sure a nice person.

IZORA RALSTON: I think people are gettin' away from that so much. Anyway, though, the old-timers used to… somebody done somethin' wrong, they just never let 'em forget it.

ZETTA WELCH: ______________. One of these days we'll go take a little tour, just us together, and we’ll tell you some things, just _____________, see it yourself. Then we can tell you some history about that from then on, if you could do that. I don't know if I had a tape recorder and get a bunch of these people together, they'd hear somethin' they never heard before. It'd be somethin' to write about.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Sure.

ZETTA WELCH: And this Ester, she's good at that. She would really _________ that.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah.

ZETTA WELCH: I want to ask her if she's got one. There's one man lives over here in town, he just loves to talk like that.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Who's that?

ZETTA WELCH: That's _____________. His wife's married to the manager of the Pony Soldier. I want to tell you ____________. Him and her together are somethin' else.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What about politics? Did people used to come and campaign in the area, your local representatives?

ZETTA WELCH: In later years, they did. They'd come around and maybe talk to you about votin' for this one or votin' for that one.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: But you don't remember a lot of political activity in the <Verde Valley>?
