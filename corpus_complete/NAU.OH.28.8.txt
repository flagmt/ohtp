SUSAN ROGERS: This is an interview with Mrs. Mary Sala and Mrs. Eva Cavaness.

MARY SALA: It's S a l a.

SUSAN ROGERS: Sala, I'm sorry. It's S a l a.

MARY SALA: It's okay, forget it.

SUSAN ROGERS: And they are Michelbach sisters, and they are <Flagstaff> natives. The interview's being conducted on January 27, 1976 at 917 W. Santa Fe in <Flagstaff>. The interviewer is Susan L. Rogers, representing the Flagstaff City-Coconino County Public Library.

Okay, would you like to tell me a little bit about your parents' background that you can remember?

MARY SALA: Well they were both born in <Germany>.

EVA CAVENESS: One was in <Heidelberg> and one was in <Vossberg>; mother was <Vossberg>.

MARY SALA: I had that little book at home. Did I take it out? Mother was born on August 10, 1876. <Vossberg Germany>.

SUSAN ROGERS:

Okay. Now what was your mother's maiden name?

MARY SALA: Veronica Schwab, S c h w a b.

SUSAN ROGERS: And do you remember how they, did they ever tell you how they ended up in <Flagstaff>?

MARY SALA: Well do you want Dad's, where he was born, too?

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh right, yeah.

MARY SALA: Born July 29, 1871 in <Konigshofen Germany>. Well they came to the U. S., Mother came ahead of Dad. And she stopped in <New York>, <New Jersey>. She was there what, one or two years. Dad was still in the army serving under Wilhelm. And then when he was released from the army, he came over to the <United States>. He settled first in <Albuquerque New Mexico> where he had a brother. And then he had a sister here in <Flagstaff>. And I guess she'd already homesteaded her place up there at the foot of the San Francisco Peaks.

EVA CAVENESS: Hart Prairie.

MARY SALA: They were married in <Flagstaff> in the Brannen Catholic Church by the Reverend Father Dilly on January 5, 1898. "To this union, ten children were born". And of course they name all the kids.

SUSAN ROGERS:I think so, if you could also maybe tell me where they are right now, and married names.

MARY SALA: All right. They are: Mrs. Eva Cavaness, <Flagstaff>; Mrs. Barbara Karstetter, <Flagstaff>; well Mary K. Sala; <Flagstaff>, Albert P. Michelbach, <Flagstaff>; Mrs. Cecilia Graves, she's in <Prescott>; Mrs. Theresa(?) Degruler(?), <Cromwell Indiana>; Mrs. Minnie Brown, oh dear, she's in <Oregon>, well <Oregon> out of <Portland>. They just moved, and I don't remember the name of the place. Mrs. Rose Mead(?) of <Winslow>; and Frank Michelbach of <Flagstaff>. There was a Joseph T. who died in 1944. He was also here in <Flagstaff>. Now, let's see. We can give you how many grandchildren and such if you would like.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

MARY SALA: All right, let me look, me look it up. Because now this here was from the . But on this, ah, write-up on mother, who passed away three years ago. At that time, now, there's been some other great grandchildren added. And I imagine we should add them. I see ah, little Mindy was born before Mother passed away, so that will give me, two, three, four of mine. Now wait a minute, there was ten kids and then, eighteen grand children. I'll just give you this and forget it. Then there was fifty-two great grand children at the time and sixteen great great grandchildren. I don't know how many was at yours?

EVA CAVENESS: Charlene, I mean Rolene(?) and Bobby's, that makes four.

MARY SALA: That's great.

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah, that's great.

MARY SALA: Well, no I just want the great ones. Rolene is a great, she's a great  because she's your daughter's daughter.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now do you ever have big family reunions at all? Do you ever get them all together?

MARY SALA: Oh we've had, well yes. We always celebrate birthdays and everything out there on the ranch. We're trying to figure out. There was fifty-two great grand children and sixteen and four would be twenty more on my side.

EVA CAVENESS: I've got four great great. Rolene's little Charlie, Bobby, and Steven and Kerry.

MARY SALA: So that would be twenty, twenty-four. Did Barbara have, Barbara Jean's kids have any?

EVA CAVENESS: Yes, my goodness.

MARY SALA: I know, but they were born __________. They've just got the one kid. A bunch of boys over there ___________.

EVA CAVENESS: Well that's Tommy, no he's got three.

MARY SALA: Oh yeah. There's Billy, Billy Pierce(?).

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah and hope we have twins. That's three with Becky.

MARY SALA: That was only two. I think the other boy's old enough to be counted before mother passed away, wasn't he?

EVA CAVENESS: I would think so.

MARY SALA: Three more wouldn't it? Twenty, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven. About twenty-seven great great grandchildren.

SUSAN ROGERS: Something like that, huh? Okay. Tell me about your last big family reunion. You said you went out to the ranch and everything?

MARY SALA: Well, Dad had already passed away when we had the reunion. We always had a little reunion, just among the family and friends. All the kids would come that could you know, on their birthdays. Dad's birthday was July and Mom was August, you know. Why we celebrated together, either Dad's or Mother's. And gee, we had some great times. So we had the first reunion, oh dear, I didn't bring any of that along. When was it? We had our second reunion just this past July. And I think it was in seventy-one that we had the first one.

EVA CAVENESS: I think up at the ranch, Hart Prairie Ranch(?).

MARY SALA: Well both of them have been up there, honey.

SUSAN ROGERS: That ranch is still owned by your family?

MARY SALA: Yeah.

EVA CAVENESS: Oh yes, uh huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: Does somebody work it now?

EVA CAVENESS: My brother.

MARY SALA: No, I've got two brothers.

EVA CAVENESS: Frank and Pete.

MARY SALA: They're just really taking care of them. Keep cattle and their horses up there, you know. But they're not farming the way my dad did. And there was over a hundred relations that attended the both of them, you know, at each of them.

EVA CAVENESS: They come clear from <Hawaii>.

MARY SALA: Now we had some...

SUSAN ROGERS: You must have filled up <Flagstaff>'s motels.

MARY SALA: We had campers and tents and everything else. There's a home up there, yeah we got a nice house up there. And everybody brought their campers. And, oh, we stayed out there, because we have a bea-u-tiful place, you know, among the aspen, just a big grove of aspen that are so beautiful in the summer ____________. That's what they come for.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you want to tell me a little bit about that ranch in your early childhood, how much you got up there? Did you spend your summers there?

MARY SALA: We had to go up there every summer. And Mother pulled us out of school, I guess about a month before it was out. Because Dad had to get his crops in by May, and Mother felt like she had to go up and help, you know, and have his meals ready when he came in from the fields. But ah, all kids in that area went to a one-room school up there. And it was about three miles from our ranch, wasn't it?

EVA CAVENESS: Oh yeah, a good three, five.

MARY SALA: Around three or four.

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah, well?

MARY SALA: And they had to go on horseback, you know, or such. But we had a one-horse buckboard as they called it. And I didn't get to go until the last year. And I think it was the first month or something, you know, in the schoolhouse. And there was a couple of boys that were?

EVA CAVENESS: Kind of rowdy.

MARY SALA: Well, they were expelled or something. They were always into mischief. So this terrible "boom" went off under the corner of the schoolhouse. And they'd set dynamite under there. (laughs). They weren't too sure, the teacher was right up there to the board. Well, it really wasn't strong enough you know, that was what it really shook us a lot. It was over with and no more school from then up there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, really?

MARY SALA: Just couldn't get any body take on. So I was a disappointed kid.

EVA CAVENESS: Well I went for three years. My brother and Barbara and I went every morning with our one-horse buckboard over and came back in the afternoon.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did the teacher now live in the little school, or did she live _________?

MARY SALA: No she lived?

EVA CAVENESS: Dillmans.

MARY SALA: Was it with the Dillmans or somebody? Another farmer that was closer to?

SUSAN ROGERS: About how many kids did you say were up there?

EVA CAVENESS: Oh I imagine?

MARY SALA: Yeah, ten or fifteen. There was only about five or six homesteaders up there. There was the Blacks and Michelbachs. What was the name that lived over there at <Little Springs> in that area? Who else did you say?

EVA CAVENESS: Dillmans.

MARY SALA: Oh, there was the Dillmans, the Michelbachs, the Blacks.

EVA CAVENESS: And the Hochderffers, George...

MARY SALA: Hochderffers. I don't know. There wasn't anybody "Bakers". I don't think the Baker girl ever? I don't think they were out there much. What the pickles was their name? Anyway there was about five of six families.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Is that school house still there, do you know?

MARY SALA: No. I understand that it was pulled down. But you know I even go by there and wonder where it turns into where it was. I imagine the foundation is still there. Because I talked to Albert Dillman there at one time, you know, and he said well it's down. It's just a frame building. Of course we took our lunch, naturally had to. And they also held dances up there. The cowboys would come in off of a round-up, or bring the family in ______ place up there, then they'd put on a big feed and we'd dance over there. And my dad played an instrument, too. When he played for dances here in town, an accordion, and he loved to dance. And my mother never did, so I don't know how they? She didn't have the chance or time.

EVA CAVENESS: Every time she turned around she had a baby. (laughs)

MARY SALA: Oh well, even before. Ye gods, that poor little gal worked ever since she was knee high to a grasshopper there in <Germany>.

MARY SALA: Well let's see, dear. Come on, you must need some more.

SUSAN ROGERS: So you used to live at that ranch, what four months out of the year, something like that, you say?

MARY SALA: Yeah, we would come in, let's see, school started again in August, September. It was after the harvest was up, more or less.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, did you used to come into town at all while?

EVA CAVENESS: The winter time.

MARY SALA: Very seldom. I mean Dad would come in the horse and buggy. It took over a half an hour to get in. And of course all the equipment was, you know, pulled by horses, you know or some with the hand, you know, see.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now was it the same road? Was it that Ft. Valley Road pretty much?

MARY SALA: There's been, no, there were several before that. You know right at the end of Ft. Valley the, oh, the fence?

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah.

MARY SALA: You turn directly right, right there, was one of them. And it just went along the fence for awhile, you know, and then turned off. Now this one here is new and it's better. And I think there was one that was a little higher up there, the first one.

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah, the little spring...

MARY SALA: Rocky. Was there a little springs on that road?

EVA CAVENESS: Uh huh, yeah.

MARY SALA: 'Course us kids would get out and beat the horses and play, because it was up hill. Get off of Ft. Valley, it was all up hill.

SUSAN ROGERS: Can you tell me a little bit about the ranch, what it looked like and maybe what kind of chores you all had to do? What your daily activities were?

MARY SALA: Well, good grief. You know we raised practically everything that we ate. We had darn good plain food. Except, you know, your flour, sugar and stuff like that. Because Dad had cattle. We raised two or three pigs. We had chickens, ducks.

EVA CAVENESS: Rabbits.

MARY SALA: And rabbits. So we always had, you know, fresh meat. Dad was a butcher by trade, so he could butcher, you know, and bring the pigs in, in the wintertime. And when it'd get breezing, they butchered them right down there in the yard, 723 W. Aspen. We always had a barrel of sauerkraut going when we'd sauerkraut. And it was always ready by the time it was hog killing. Dad made all his sausage. He cured his hams, his bacon. And Babbitts' had a smokehouse that sat there where the Penney's store is right in there now, see, about in the middle of it, about where the alley is. And then we'd smoke them down there. Talk about good stuff. He made all his sausage again, pork sausages. Mother baked?

EVA CAVENESS: Cheese, bread. Baked her own bread?

MARY SALA: Mother made all her bread; cinnamon rolls, coffeecakes, cakes, pies. About the only time we got any pies or cakes was probably somebody's birthday. 'Cause everything was she couldn’t ______afford. She didn't have time either. She always had good puddings and fruit. Because we always had dried fruit. She'd buy it every winter, buy the twenty-five pound boxes. Of course we had cows to milk. We had, really didn't have much water on the place. So we had to take them about two miles, or as we called about a tank, to water the horses and the cows. There was one year we milked about sixteen cows. But we always had three or four where we had our own butter, our cream, all our cottage cheese, all the milk we could drink. And ah, none of us liked clabber. Except __________ our aunt that lived over the hill. We'd take it to her. Of course we had chickens to feed. We had?

EVA CAVENESS: Pigs to slop.

MARY SALA: Mother, well weeds to pull. That was the hardest thing.

SUSAN ROGERS: Well, did you have crops?

EVA CAVENESS: Oh yeah.

MARY SALA: The big crops was grain, hay and potatoes. And Dad got blue ribbons on his potatoes at the state fair every, not the state, but the county fair. I guess he took some down to the state fair, too.

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah, I think so.

MARY SALA: And he got ribbons also on his grains.

EVA CAVENESS: And his rutabagas, too.

MARY SALA: Yeah. That was his hearty things. Because we had no irrigation, we had to depend on the rain. And so it was hard work. Sometimes we'd have beautiful crops; next time no rain. Or it would come and then freeze. Oh heavens!

SUSAN ROGERS:

What about drinking water now, or did you usually get a well?

EVA CAVENESS: A well.

MARY SALA: Well, we had a well there just below the house for awhile, and of course it dried up in time. And then there was a little spring about a quarter of a mile from my house, so we had to carry water down from there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now is that spring that Babbitt Tanks again?

MARY SALA: No, it was in the same area. No, it was on our land. No, this Babbitt Tanks was clear on over.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now did you used to sell a lot of these crops and chickens and everything or was it mainly?

MARY SALA: The chickens and things no, but the hay, yes. We baled the hay and sold hay; dad sold hay, and he sold potatoes, but the rest, shoot.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now did he have farm hands helping him or did all of you kids do the work?

MARY SALA: Oh, we helped. And then there was one man that lived just, old Billy Beach, and, ah, what was the other guy's name that lived?

EVA CAVENESS: Joe Fisher?

MARY SALA: His name was Fisher, wasn't it?

EVA CAVENESS: Fisher, yes.

MARY SALA: Well, you know, everybody got together and helped each, you know. They had to. 'Cause I know we'd go over to Blacks; they'd help, come on over. My aunt would come over, and we'd go over and help her. So they all had to pitch in and help each other.

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah, good neighbors. They were really nice neighbors.

MARY SALA: Well they had to. It was the only way they could?

EVA CAVENESS: Get their crops up.

MARY SALA: And no one could afford help, you know, a few dollars a day, I guess, or less than that. And of course their board and room.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now your father had a cattle herd, is that right?

EVA CAVENESS: Oh, yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now did he bring this into town to ship it somewhere, or how did he?

MARY SALA: Well, they did. They had an area, and they would gather up the cattle that was up there. Be the Babbitts and Michelbachs and such, you now, and of course Dad was with the cowboys right along with them. And then they had a loading area out of town. It was somewhere.

EVA CAVENESS: <Winona>, wasn't it <Winona>?

MARY SALA: I don't think it was down that far. You see Babbitts' had that slaughterhouse out on, I think it was right around that area. It must have been about a mile.

SUSAN ROGERS: Out there on Butler or something?

EVA CAVENESS: Out there by Butler. It's in that area.

SUSAN ROGERS: So, would them right through town when they brought them in?

MARY SALA: Yeah, they had to. There was no trucking or anything.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did they ever have any accidents, do you remember?

MARY SALA: Well, there wasn't too many, there wasn't traffic(?) like you have today. I mean the highways and all. They did have to watch them, of course, and the railroads and things, well what was it? They'd go under, you know, they'd have those big culverts or something, you know, that sat up high where they could go through, but there wasn't too many automobiles in those days, you know. So really there was? it was no hassle.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

MARY SALA: But today, heck, we would get 'cause everything's trucked down, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, can you tell me a little bit about those neighbors up there, what you remember about the different people, I mean the Blacks ________?

MARY SALA: Don't get me started. (all laugh) Ah, they was just good neighbors really. We didn't have much chance to get together very often, because they lived, we all lived about a mile apart, I guess. Blacks, I guess, was the closest, and then my aunt over the hill. She didn't have no kids.

EVA CAVENESS: And then Dillmans were about two miles.

MARY SALA: Well, yes, where that Wilson ranch is up there. I don't know if you've been up in that area or not. Oh, I'm trying to think. I think it was down there, you know, where you turn in on the little springs, Nieman(?) Moore, you know, raised the pigs. (several undecipherable comments follow.) But really we did very seldom get together. Because they all had to, helped each other. And then going to school, too, you know, why they had to? The only time we'd really get together, probably they'd come over on Sunday. Because my dad believed on resting on Sunday, and unless it looked a storm or something, the potatoes needed to come in, or he had the hay down, and so we all got out and worked.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Now when you lived in town, where did you live?

MARY SALA: 723 W. Aspen. And we were all born there except Eva. You were born up there in Mill Town.

SUSAN ROGERS: You were born in Mill Town? And then do you remember very much of Mill Town at all, or?

EVA CAVENESS: Well, the little house was torn down here about two years ago where I was born.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh really?

EVA CAVENESS: Uh huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: Well which one was that?

EVA CAVENESS: Well it was a Riordan home, right on? kind of a little Riordan house there on 66.

MARY SALA: Was in that area there, you know. Because that was the only thing that was out here was that Saginaw Mill. And even Dad worked there, you know for two or three years. No, he was the, oh yeah when he got the homestead he left there. Why then he would come in and he'd work for Babbitts' in the butcher shop.

SUSAN ROGERS: Tell me about the homestead in that day. What were the rules? Do you remember how you got one and everything?

MARY SALA: I don't know, but I had this big, I don't know, a legal sheet. And I guess they just applied. And it was signed by Teddy Roosevelt. And, of course, the kids had to have it, because of the mineral rights and water rights, you know. And I gave it to Frank about a month ago. So, really I don't know. That's the only thing that I've seen on that was just this legal sheet, you know. And saying where it was, and what it was, and the mineral rights and water rights, and such. And then old Teddy Roosevelt, and I guess it was in, I thought it was dated 1904 when he, when that was signed by him. But I don't know when Dad really went up there and started to farm. But you(?) said before the late 1918s see...

EVA CAVENESS: After he left <Albuquerque> was when he came up here to see his sister.

MARY SALA: I don't know whether they had to live on it and improve it, and then they would give them the legal right to homestead. And you had to do it within a certain time, I think. I think that's the way it's gone for years.

EVA CAVENESS: You got to improve on it.

MARY SALA: Show your, that that's what you want it for, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Do you want to tell me a little bit about that neighborhood over on Aspen Street? Who were your neighbors, and how many houses around you at that time?

MARY SALA: Well let's see, there was the Hoffmans across the street, there was? who lived directly across from us?

EVA CAVENESS: Heckethorns. Did they live in that one?

MARY SALA: Yeah, I guess they did before they went over on the other street.

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah, Heckethorns and the Hoffmans.

MARY SALA: And then Attorney Gold and his family. I don't know who lived there before Gold. Well Kuntzelmans lived there. Don't you remember when they came from <Missouri>? He remodeled that house all together. Well they are the first ones I remember. Kuntzelmans.

EVA CAVENESS: They lived in Gold's place.

MARY SALA: Yeah, but it was just a little shack, too. And Golds, you know, remodeled it all together and built anew, I don't know. But of course he still lives there.

EVA CAVENESS: There was old Chet Black, you know, where?

MARY SALA: Yeah. The lot is just a block up from us, so on Cherry.

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah, and Bennett. Was Frank Bennetts, were they further down?

MARY SALA: No, behind us was the Barths.

EVA CAVENESS: Barths, yeah.

MARY SALA: And then the Matt Blacks were just a block below us. And then the Comptons, a block above us. There was the Allens, they had one girl. We'd get out on Saturdays and Sundays and play "run sheepie run" and have a lot of fun.

EVA CAVENESS: "Kick the can" or "hide and seek".

MARY SALA: Yeah, what was it, the Castleberrys, too, lived down in that area. Just a gang around there.

SUSAN ROGERS: You said the "Heckethorns". Is that the Heckethorns that had the area out in Lake Mary? S and

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: That was their homestead or something?

MARY SALA: Well, all the kids was out there, the old folks, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. And what? did you go to Emerson?

MARY SALA: No, we went to the Nativity.

SUSAN ROGERS: St. Anthony?

EVA CAVENESS: St. Anthony was then by that name.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, do you want to tell me a little bit maybe about that building and what kind of discipline you had?

MARY SALA: Well that building is the one that, it was a frame building where the health food? they moved it away from there and moved it there, you know where the health food is?

EVA CAVENESS: That used to be our?

SUSAN ROGERS: That used to be the one that you started? Then there was a different St. Anthonys later then, too.

MARY SALA: Well, then they built? I don't know, there's none of that there. But it was, there was an area, an open area in the center, and they had a grotto in there. And the sisters lived on the one side in the back. And then the front end was the schoolrooms. The front end was used for the church then, wasn't it?

EVA CAVENESS: Yes.

MARY SALA: Yeah, they had the church. It was moved over from Brannen, where the Brannen homes are over there now. That's our first church was over there. And then there was schoolrooms up stairs, school rooms on the other side up stairs. So, they had a library up there, I think on the same side. And believe me we had to go to church every Sunday, every Holy Day of Obligation.

EVA CAVENESS: Every first Friday, during Lent, we had the Station Of The Cross on Fridays.

MARY SALA: My mother was a very religious woman, believe me.

SUSAN ROGERS: In other words, there was quite a large Catholic population in <Flagstaff> at that time.

MARY SALA: Yeah. There were, because the people that opened up the mill was Riordans and all, and they were Catholics, you know. And there was the biggest part of Catholics just come out from <St. Louis> and that area there. And he was part of them. You ask them where they were from "<St. Louis>". So it was?

EVA CAVENESS: 'Course Babbitts were Catholics.

MARY SALA: They're the first ones to have, you know, they've been established, that store down there is eighteen something.

EVA CAVENESS: They've been there now, let's see, eighty-six years.

MARY SALA: The Nichols are Catholics. Majority of those old timers, well I guess most of them gone. Dad really was one of those last ones that ever? I don't know, there's are a few of them left yet, but they're down there in homes and things.

EVA CAVENESS: <Phoenix>.

SUSAN ROGERS: What about the discipline in the Catholic schools?

MARY SALA: They were, well they're always strict. You really, yeah?

EVA CAVENESS: You betcha.

MARY SALA: Of course I know it's different today. It's not as, you know, as strict. But believe me, we'd get our hands hit with a ruler. And you'd better not come home and tell Mother or Dad or you'd get another one. We were always too blame, so we didn't keep your mouth shut. (laughs) But really I appreciated the _____.

EVA CAVENESS: You betcha. Didn't hurt us one bit.


MARY SALA: Fourth of July, well have you interviewed Jack Fuss down here?

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah.

MARY SALA: You got the Fourth of July best from him, you know. He really started that Pow Wow and a few more things. So really?

SUSAN ROGERS: I just wondered if maybe you remember any earlier ones before it was really the Pow Wow?

MARY SALA: Well, I don't know. What were the celebrations that they'd bring that stand that's still around? I think and didn't it sit there at the depot where they played the music?

EVA CAVENESS: And then they had the park up there with music, and we used to dance on the pavilion.

MARY SALA: Yeah well, the deal that the orchestra played in is still around you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: Uh huh, that one.

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah, down there by the Chamber of Commerce.

MARY SALA: They'd bring it up here, and I don't know.

EVA CAVENESS: We had it for the pavilion.

MARY SALA: Just floor boards.

EVA CAVENESS: Just floor boards and sticks up above. And they did do a little, I don't know, racing and bronco busting and things up there. Nothing?

MARY SALA: Well heck, ______________

EVA CAVENESS: Then we had the race track out here where the University is, where every year the boys would run races. But that's all been built up.

MARY SALA: Car races?

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah, regular car races.

MARY SALA: I know Warren did.

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now, how many years did that last, those car races?

EVA CAVENESS: Oh my goodness, I don't know.

MARY SALA: 1914 I think there were only one or two cars around here.

(undecipherable conversation at this point.) Up at the little Ponderosa when Papa was up there(?). (Probably referring to the Ponderosa Convalescent Hospital.)

EVA CAVENESS: Was in with mother when mother had her room up there. (Referring to the Ponderosa; undecipherable conversation)

MARY SALA: Oh, that old lady was Jackie Gabaldon's grandmother, Jackie Galbadon's grandmother.

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah.

MARY SALA: Oh, what was her name? What about her?

EVA CAVENESS: Both of their sons run races out here at the racetrack.

MARY SALA: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

EVA CAVENESS: I think there was something in the paper about that racetrack.

MARY SALA: Well we had the circuses, too, that pitched their tents out there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now, where was that?

MARY SALA: Around the University, you know. Just below there because that was just open country.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now, were these circuses that came in on the train or something, or??

MARY SALA: No, I guess they had their own wagons. Yeah, they just had their own, as far as I know.

EVA CAVENESS: We liked to go to the circus and didn't have any money to go to the circus.

MARY SALA: Well, we watered the elephants.

EVA CAVENESS: (laughs) Yeah.

MARY SALA: Oh we made it.

EVA CAVENESS: I can remember when mother and dad, they were out with the potato crop, and the circus came to town, Joe and I wanted to go to that circus so bad. And it cost fifty cents.

MARY SALA: What did you do? Sell Dad's potatoes out from under has nose. (all laugh)

EVA CAVENESS: No, gosh, we finally, we finally? We did ________, and they gave each fifty cents, and we went to the circus.

MARY SALA: Did you?

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah, they finally gave us the fifty cents to get rid or us.

MARY SALA: Well God love them. I'm telling you they worked hard for that fifty cents. You were lucky.

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Has the cemeteries moved at all, can you remember?

MARY SALA: No.

SUSAN ROGERS: They're the same ones.

MARY SALA: Ours hasn't moved.

EVA CAVENESS: Citizens is the same.

MARY SALA: Bigger.

SUSAN ROGERS: What do you know about the early down town area, some of the stores?

EVA CAVENESS: Babbitts' in 1889.

MARY SALA: Well there wasn't too much, really. Babbitts had the dry goods, they had groceries, they had drug stores, butcher shop.

EVA CAVENESS: Butcher shop, all furniture; all of that, hardware.

MARY SALA: I don't know what was across the street. You see that one block in there, that whole thing, even commercial ___________, I guess was one of the old.

EVA CAVENESS: Herman, oh, Ed(?) Herman.

MARY SALA: He had the shoe business, didn't he?

EVA CAVENESS: Herman, and dresses, yeah, he had a regular?

MARY SALA: Yeah, yeah.

EVA CAVENESS: And then the Switzer's--hardware.

MARY SALA: That hardware's been there for years. Now it's run by Bowen(?). Have you interviewed them?

SUSAN ROGERS: I've interviewed the two sisters.

MARY SALA: Yeah, oh.

EVA CAVENESS: Agnes and, oh?

SUSAN ROGERS: I can't think of the other one right now, either.

MARY SALA: It isn't Reba; Reba isn't here.

EVA CAVENESS: Ardelle, not Ardelle, either.

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah, it was Ardelle.

MARY SALA: It's the one that's married to the fellow that was hurt?

EVA CAVENESS: Ag, no.

MARY SALA: Hors(?), or something, he's been an invalid ever since then. Yes, I can tell you a whole lot, course they told you about the place there. And then the only restaurants we had was old Bender, you know.

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah.

MARY SALA: Bender's restaurant. And then there was a chinese restaurant.

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah.

MARY SALA: And where was the telephone company, right there?

EVA CAVENESS: It was in the Commercial.

MARY SALA: It went up to the little lines there, something? Wasn't it in there for awhile?

EVA CAVENESS: Well Weatherford, that's where I worked. Yeah, I worked there for the telephone.

MARY SALA: Yeah, I know you did. Was it there in the Commercial?

EVA CAVENESS: No, Weatherford, Weatherford.

MARY SALA: Oh, in the Weatherford.

EVA CAVENESS: Yes, the Weatherford Hotel. Right next door to the Weatherford Hotel.

MARY SALA: Yeah, the Weatherford. I remember you working in there.

EVA CAVENESS: And then right across the street was, what do they call, a delicatessen. It was Bader's, Bader's Delicatessen.

MARY SALA: There was a drug store right across from there, too, 'cause I worked in it.

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah.

MARY SALA: Yeah, I worked in that drug store.

EVA CAVENESS: Then there was a confection down where, who had that?

MARY SALA: That was right across from Babbitts'.

EVA CAVENESS: Where Baders, where Bakers is. Not Bakers, but right next to Bakers there at the alley. They called it a "confection", and the only place you could get ice cream.

MARY SALA: Well, you could get ice cream at my place. We had ice cream.

EVA CAVENESS: That was maybe before?

MARY SALA: I guess all drug stores did in those days. Gosh, there wasn't anything that I didn't work at, by gosh. There wasn't too many jobs.

EVA CAVENESS: I worked for the Confection Den for four hours; I worked for the Telephone Company for four hours. Then mom got after me and told me I had to quit one or the other. So, they put me on eight hours with the Telephone Company, and I worked there.

MARY SALA: Well sure, jou’d be silly not to.

SUSAN ROGERS: Where were some of the big social spots in town?

EVA CAVENESS: Oh dear.

MARY SALA: The Marlar(?) Dance Hall, I guess, and the picture show, the Orpheum.

EVA CAVENESS: The Orpheum.

SUSAN ROGERS: What was the first one you said?

MARY SALA: Marlar's(?) Dance Hall, Pavilion. Well it was sitting right there where the Harpers' Furniture used to be. I think it's part of the City.

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah, right there at the Harper's Furniture.

MARY SALA: They moved out and now that's?

EVA CAVENESS: Well the City's in there now.

MARY SALA: Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Across from the Orpheum? And there used to be a big dance hall?

MARY SALA: Jitney band, they had the Jitney band, were there.

EVA CAVENESS: Just marvelous.

MARY SALA: It was enclosed with just ah, what was it, kind of a wood fence around. And of course you, what would you do, pay a nickel if you wanted to get inside that circle to dance. We called the Jitney band.

SUSAN ROGERS: What is that word from, "jitney"?

MARY SALA: I don't know.

EVA CAVENESS: Jitney's a nickel, isn't it?

MARY SALA: Well that's what it represented with us kids. You never hear about it much. Did anybody ever tell you that?

SUSAN ROGERS: One other person mentioned it just last week, and I had never heard? Now how often were these dances held?

MARY SALA: I think every Saturday.

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah, Saturday.

MARY SALA: And I guess on celebrations, too.

SUSAN ROGERS: Would a lot of kids go down, and all the adults and everybody?

MARY SALA: Oh, yeah.

EVA CAVENESS: I think that every body that wanted to dance would go.

MARY SALA: I know we were always there. We loved to dance. I think they had dances up there at _________ school house; then out at Doney Park; they? that school out there. (Speaks aside excusing herself.)

EVA CAVENESS: Just like the schools.

SUSAN ROGERS: What do you remember about some of the different people in town, either characters or prominent, you know, government, judges? Do you remember Judge Doe?

MARY SALA: Doe?

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah. He lived on Beaver and Dale.

EVA CAVENESS: Seems to me, yes I do. And, there was Judge Kemp, too.

MARY SALA: Judge Kemp and Judge Russell and then Harrington.

MARY SALA: Yeah, I heard of Doe, but I can't remember?

EVA CAVENESS: And, ah?

MARY SALA: He's probably one of the first ones.

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah, I think so, yes.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember anything in particular about him?

EVA CAVENESS: No, I don't.

SUSAN ROGERS: You just remember the name.

MARY SALA: Does anybody else know anything about him?

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah, I know a little bit. See, I live in his house now. That's why I wanted to know.

MARY SALA: Oh.

SUSAN ROGERS: 'Cause he(?) lived down in that big white house on the corner.

MARY SALA: If you knew when he passed away you probably could go to the Sun.

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah, I've done a little research.

MARY SALA: Have you?

SUSAN ROGERS: Mary Greenlaw Draine.

MARY SALA: Oh yeah, yeah, she'd be good. Her and her sister both, you know. They knew a lot of it. So really, you know, there's enough old timers left, you know, that could give you just a lot of? I don't know, let's see, I jotted down a few things that ______, just let me check. I think that we've covered that much, but there still some stuff there. Oh yeah, I think we should tell them about how much Dad did building the church.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, okay.

MARY SALA: Ah, there is something here that I felt was so very good. Turn it off a minute, please. Dad retired, you know, from going up to the ranch, because it worried us a lot, because he'd go up there with a wagon and team alone, you know. And, of course, that main road to the Canyon's up there now. And, so we finally had to put a stop to it. And it broke his heart, because he couldn't have his horses around anymore. But then during the winter, why he'd go out and shovel snow for people. And he still did it when he was ninety-two, practically. Well he died, he was ninety-two years old when he died, ninety-one. Then when he had the horses and team; now they could keep their horses and cows and things. We always had one cow in town. Because the ordinance isn't like it is today. Can't have even a chicken running around. But anyway, he would take the team and go down there to the depot and keep that cleared off. And he'd take his team, and what was that, what did they call that big scoop?

EVA CAVENESS: Shovel?

MARY SALA: No, it was a scoop. Don't you remember the double handle on it?

EVA CAVENESS: They called it, ah?

MARY SALA: Well, it was a big scoop about this wide. And he would hold the handle, you know, and the horses would pull it. Then he would haul it off to the side. He would also? we had a sled, and he would also take kids sleigh riding. Sled, and then the college kids, for a number of years would hire him, and take him on hayrides. 'Cause he had a wagon and team for hayrides. So he did all that. And as I say, the snow shovelling down there, every year, or every winter, you know, down there at the depot. It was the only way, you know?

EVA CAVENESS: Ralph(?) down here, and I don't know, he had so many nice people.

MARY SALA: Well I know, but I'm talking about the early years, and he kept that. But when he got older, sure, he took care of that, because he worked at Babbitts' there when he was younger. Surely you must have found something about the church.

EVA CAVENESS: There's hardly anything on here. Nothing in this, paper.

MARY SALA: Are you starting at the beginning of each paragraph there?

(Both searching pages)

EVA CAVENESS: There was one hundred sixty acres put into grain, hay, crops each year.

SUSAN ROGERS: I think about 1929, 1930 wasn't it?

MARY SALA: Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Right in there.

EVA CAVENESS: We hauled the rock, you can say.

MARY SALA: Well, all the towns people got together and, of course, I guess, Tom and our Uncle Steve. Tom was the only one who had wagon and teams in those days.

EVA CAVENESS: Steve did all that.

MARY SALA: And I remember one, because in reading this, that he said that he figured that he hauled in about five hundred loads. And it had to be special malapais. It had to have that moss on it.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now where did he go to get it? Do you remember?

MARY SALA: Oh different areas around here. You can, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: You see it, yeah.

MARY SALA: Yeah, you see it. But they better not bring anything but with that moss on it, because Father Albouy, that's what he'd demand and that's what they got. And then, I guess, Uncle Steve, he was a stone mason, and he's done a lot as a stone mason.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now what was his last name?

MARY SALA: Eck?

EVA CAVENESS: E c k.

MARY SALA: He did a lot of?

EVA CAVENESS: He did that pretty thing up in front of the Nativity Church and the statue in there, too.

MARY SALA: Well he put them in there, but he didn't make it.

EVA CAVENESS: No, no, no. He put the statues in.

MARY SALA: A good mason. And I think he did some masonry work up there at the University, too, college.

EVA CAVENESS: And he did some out at <Leupp>, too.

MARY SALA: Oh, yeah.

EVA CAVENESS: Made all the schools(?) _________.

MARY SALA: And then down <Oak Creek> way there. Took them ________ _________ down there.

EVA CAVENESS: For that we're proud.

SUSAN ROGERS: What about, what ones did he do on campus, do you remember?

MARY SALA: Why, I think it was part Old Main. That was the only building there, you know, for so long. And then the dormitories there, just below it; Morton Hall and, well, ah, Tinsley, you know was the? that's where they had the dining room. Tinsley Hall there, you know, that was the dining room and that's where? wasn't Mrs., what was her name who did all the cooking?

EVA CAVENESS: Ah.

MARY SALA: The woman. She had a son named Joe. Married the Whipple girl. Hanley.

EVA CAVENESS: Hanley.

MARY SALA: Mrs. Hanley, yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. You were talking about having cows in town. Now did you sell the milk to your neighbors, or was this just for your family?

MARY SALA: We gave it away if we had any surplus.

EVA CAVENESS: Eggs and butter.

MARY SALA: And we took it down to the Sisters, really. We gave it to the Sisters of Loretto. Because, you know, they, those people, you know the Sisters, they just? a small salary. I think they were getting, what, about thirty dollars a month.

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah, something like that. And they would support themselves and pay their insurance, and, you know.

MARY SALA: So mother? we always had to take the milk down to them and give them eggs.

EVA CAVENESS: You know, if mother would bake or anything, she sent cinnamon rolls or bread.

MARY SALA: Many a cold night, dark, I took a pail of milk down to the Sisters. No, we just had the one cow just for our own use. And any surplus, as I say, went to the Sisters. Oh, my mother was always helping somebody.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. What do you remember about the flu epidemic of 1918?

MARY SALA: I don't think we had anything that bad since.

SUSAN ROGERS: Really.

MARY SALA: We lost a little baby sister eighteen months old that year. Our family, I think everybody, was down except mother and I. You were, were you in <Chicago>?

EVA CAVENESS: I was in <Chicago>. But Mother had to come for me. I was on my deathbed, and I was about seven months pregnant with Charlie.

MARY SALA: But they were all down except Mother and I. I was too tough, I guess. But someone had to stay and take care of the eleven kids, ten, eight, whatever there were. So that really was bad. I guess they had people down there in the old Emerson school, full of beds there, you know, for the sick.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now did you have any doctors that actually came to see you or did the family just take care of the family?

EVA CAVENESS: Dr. Manning.

MARY SALA: Oh, yeah. We had several doctors. One of them's still living, old Dr. Fronske.

EVA CAVENESS: And we had Dr., ah?

MARY SALA: Mannings.

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah.

MARY SALA: There was two Mannings.

EVA CAVENESS: And who else, oh, the one who brought Therese into the world.

SUSAN ROGERS: Dr. Sherman, Raymond.

MARY SALA: Sherman was there, too. He's buried out here.

SUSAN ROGERS: Dr. Raymond?

MARY SALA: Oh Raymond, yes, Dr. Raymond.

SUSAN ROGERS: What about? what hospitals were there in the area?

MARY SALA: There was the mill hospital up there. They came to the house. Babies were delivered there. They were doctors. They knew what they were doing, horse and buggy doctors.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now when you were out at the ranch, did they used to ever have to make calls out there at all?

MARY SALA: Oh, heck no. My mother had home remedies that they still use some today. Believe me. She cured us, don't think she didn't.(all laugh). And the main thing, if we got a cold, was the mustard plaster. And if you got sick in any way, she'd give us a dose of castor oil. That cured everything. If you run a nail in your foot, she would put it in hot epsom salts water.

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah, with turpentine in it.

MARY SALA: You have to. Before they, they're darn good today. I don't go to the doctor for little things like that. Pretty near cut my finger off. Boy I wouldn't stop bleeding, then put some _______ around, and can't even see the scar now. _______ but boy, I went clear to the bone.

Dad had to be a mechanic, really. If anything broke down of the equipment, heck, he'd have to use what's around there from old rusty tin to rusty iron, to baling wire. There was a lot of things held together by baling wire. Don't think there wasn't. No we were fifteen miles out there. The only time Dad got to town was when he?

EVA CAVENESS: Needed groceries.

MARY SALA: Groceries, you know.

EVA CAVENESS: Either once a week or once, or twice a month.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay, can you tell me a little bit about the water shortage?

MARY SALA: Oh, it was terrible, too. I'm afraid it's going to happen again. There was only about, what, less than eight thousand people, and there was a shortage. And they had to ship it in from <Winslow>. Oh that water'd just like to kill us, because ours was so fresh.

EVA CAVENESS: Fresh, yeah, we used to go to <Little Springs> up here and haul it down.

MARY SALA: Yeah, we had to walk up here with a bucket. Everybody had to.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now did you have to stand in line, then?

MARY SALA: No, no when they brought it up from <Winslow>, it was delivered by wagon. They put it in barrels, and then you paid so much for a barrel that you had sitting there where they could fill it. But up here, you could get what you wanted, of course?

SUSAN ROGERS: So would you have to go everyday, wouldn't you?

EVA CAVENESS: Well every other day anyway.

MARY SALA: Yeah. It's according to how many there were to carry it back, how long you had to wait in line. I imagine there was a number. I was telling the soldier about that spring up there. Some I guess maybe lived out that area. There was one out there by the Lockett place. Don't you remember there was a spring there by the side of the road; I don't know if it's still running or not. Of course, Lake Mary out here, then was built by the Riordans. That's why, they had a daughter named Mary and they?

EVA CAVENESS: Named it Lake Mary.

MARY SALA: Named it Lake Mary, and that has saved us many a time. Boy if they don't start looking for water soon, I don't know what they are going to do.

EVA CAVENESS: I'd hate to see that happen again, really.

MARY SALA: It was bad enough when the, you know, there wasn't too many of them.

EVA CAVENESS: But, my goodness, the water that’s used now. What's the population of <Flagstaff>?

SUSAN ROGERS: About thirty thousand.

EVA CAVENESS: Thirty thousand population?

MARY SALA: Then they're like <Phoenix>, they didn't count everybody. I was gone, no, and Mary was gone out there, you know, and she came around for the information, whether she came back or not, I don’t know, but I was never approached. And I noticed there was a lot of them in <Phoenix>. You remember they were hollerin' about it wanting a recount. And they said cost too much, oh, that's all right. I don't care.

SUSAN ROGERS: What do you remember about any bootleggers; bootlegging activity?

MARY SALA: I wasn't old enough to drink, but I know there was plenty of it going on. And I think there was stills right over here on the other side of that track. At least it was bought, you know. And it was served over there.

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah, and there's a still out at Lake Mary, too, I, think there was a still out there.

MARY SALA: Oh, well they were all out hid under trees or something. But by durn they had it, don't think didn't. We made, really, Mother made our own wine.

EVA CAVENESS: Dandelion.

MARY SALA: And root beer. But as hard as my dad worked, believe me, he had to have, you know, some, but he wasn't a heavy drinker or anything.

SUSAN ROGERS: Well, how'd you make the wine?

MARY SALA: Well there was wild goose berries up there on the mountain. We had to pick them.

SUSAN ROGERS: You said dandelion, huh?

MARY SALA: She didn't. I know of people that did make dandelion wine. But then she would take, I don't know, raisins or prunes or something; fruits, different things. She made jelly out of those up there, too. Oh, they were stinkers! They were wild, you know, and they had stickers on them about that long. I don't know what Mother made, fruits, and things I guess. I think it was raisins, wasn't it? Yeah I think so.

EVA CAVENESS: It's a malt that you buy ________ I don't know.

MARY SALA: No, the malt was for beer. This was sugar ferment, you know. But, we were making by the tub and everything else. But, if you didn't get the doggone beer corked on right, why, you know, it would be in the parlor. (laughs) But she made the best root beer; gosh it was good. Of course we'd bottle them. I don't know, do you know where that old bottler is? Lot of things, the old butter churn, too.

SUSAN ROGERS: What about the effect of the depression on your family?

MARY SALA: Well it was surprising. It didn't affect our town too bad. Oh, there was a lot of them on the soup lines. But our family, we had, you know, were on the ranch, and we never had to go on the soup lines. Because raising really the main things, we always had, you know, plenty to eat. But I know that they had a soup line, too, all right.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now where would these soup lines be?

MARY SALA: I don't know where it was, I never got to it. Down there, I guess somewhere.

SUSAN ROGERS: Down town somewhere.

MARY SALA: Yeah, I guess. That's the truth, I don't know. Obviously, a lot of them didn't know what they were doing. I don't know. I don't know that we had(?) to go. I'm not a braggin', see but, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: I can see having a ranch. Okay what about any transient hoboes coming through? Was there quite a bit of that?

MARY SALA: Yeah. Those days they were, but they were willing to work for what ever you gave them. They, "can I do", "can I chop wood", "can I do this or that", you know, for a bite to eat. But today they go through and if you ask them to do something, why you insult them.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now, how many were coming through? Did somebody come to your house every day?

MARY SALA: Oh no. I imagine you'd probably have one every two weeks or so, because you see, the railroad going right down here, they would jump off and go on up the hill up this way. Sometimes the poor thing had a heck of a time getting up, why they could jump off, you know. And easily walk on over, because we were in there. The first house we'd probably refuse them. My mother, if they wanted to do something, she'd never turn down anybody that was hungry. But really, they were really hoboes, you know, just good people. Look how many we've got today. And if they can stop you and get a ride, you know, and then hold you up or something and take your car away from you.

SUSAN ROGERS: Which leads me on to crimes. Do you remember any particular crimes when you were young?

MARY SALA: If there was, there were very darn few in those days.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay.

MARY SALA: May have been a few, I don't know, there may have been a few thieves on up there or cattle rustlers or something like that,like you see in the movies. But I don't think there was up in this area. Well see, there was old Joe Kellam, and the Babbitts, and Dad, and, I don't know, there wasn't too many cattleman.

SUSAN ROGERS: Show(?) me a little bit about Joe Kellam. I've heard a little bit about him.

MARY SALA: I wish someone else tell you about him. I don't know nothing about him.

EVA CAVENESS: I don't know much about him either.

MARY SALA: We know, he was, see he was up at the house once in awhile, but really, a cattleman. And I don't know who could tell you much about him. He was quite a character. Oh, I don't know.

SUSAN ROGERS: Henry Giclas seemed to remembered him.

MARY SALA: I remember him, too.

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah, I can remember him, too.

MARY SALA: In fact he was around here a long time. What was he? About a seven footer and he used to attend the dances up there at the University. He gave a scholarship; some kind of twenty-five dollar scholarship. He'd get up there and present it. And we thought he'd never shut his mouth. And he could have afforded a thousand and twenty-five. Thought he was giving his life savings away. (all laugh).

SUSAN ROGERS: What about fires? Any big fires, do you remember?

MARY SALA: I don't know. Was, did we have any mill fire, you remember?

SUSAN ROGERS: Or neighborhood fire?

MARY SALA: Yeah, the old Brooks place down here. The only fire we knew.

EVA CAVENESS: And right across the street, the Hoffman fire, too; the Hoffmans had a fire.

MARY SALA: It didn't burn it down, though.

EVA CAVENESS: The back kitchen; the back part of the house.

MARY SALA: This was down here where the trailer park is, right across from the Vandeviers; you know. Half of that block there was a store. I guess it burnt to the ground.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now what year was that about?

MARY SALA: I imagine that was, I don't know, my youngsters were small. Because I knew they had the?

END TAPE 1, SIDE 2, BEGIN TAPE 2, SIDE 1

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. You were saying a little bit about that fire.

MARY SALA: Yeah, my kids were small, and they had the measles. And I lived down there on Aspen. And they wanted to watch it, so I put dark glasses on them and just let them sit, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: And watch it, huh.

MARY SALA: And I don't know how old they were. So I imagine that's been about forty(?) years ago.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. How about any floods?

MARY SALA: Yes ma’am. That river down there flood over there.

EVA CAVENESS: Yes, that down town area is all flood area.

MARY SALA: It would flood clear down there up to the? it inclined a little bit there at the show house, don't you remember? And that Midgley place was there on the corner, and it just practically sat right on the ground, you know. And they really did flood out. But really, it did, when it really thawed on the mountains, it would all come down. And it went to the top and over. And of course it's on an incline there, and down it went. Then it got in that pocket there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now how long did it usually sit around, then? How much inconvenience was it?

EVA CAVENESS: I think a couple of days by the time it dried or we seen it.

MARY SALA: Well it went into the ground, too, because, pavement, we didn't have pavement up until when? It was all mud.

SUSAN ROGERS: So it closed, were there wooden side walks then? Did it float the sidewalks, can you remember?

MARY SALA: They were all board sidewalks.

EVA CAVENESS: But there wasn't a boardwalk on most of these streets.

MARY SALA: So I don't know, it really was kind of a lake down in there. But they still get lakes over there by the college and some of these places. Under the under pass over there. Isn't that terrible? They didn't have the drainage. They've got drainage now, but it don't seem to do any good.

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember any accidents occurring because of these floods, or anybody hurt at all?

MARY SALA: Nah. I don't think they had any.

SUSAN ROGERS: They didn't come swooping down, really.

MARY SALA: No.

EVA CAVENESS: They didn't come that fast.

MARY SALA: Because there's nobody that really went down in it, you know. It isn't like some of these places on the reservation where you'd have those flash floods. This here gradually would come up. There was no flash flood. But all that waste water, all that water come on down. Now some of it's been diverted out here, somewhere. So we, they were talking about, though, sometimes it might flood again, you know. They should do something about the river, because it's quite shallow, you know, down here where it goes, it gets pretty shallow there next to the railroad. Down in that area, you know. Now where I live there, you know, it's deeper. That's about the deepest spot, those two blocks there. Because I think up further it's still shallow. Well we lived clear up here; it didn't bother us, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. I know there were lots of blizzards. Do you remember any particular winters that were bad or?

MARY SALA: Blizzards?

SUSAN ROGERS: Blizzards, snow fall.

MARY SALA: I don't know. Winters here, they were big every year, and it was nothing to have four or five feet, you know. And, of course, we lived, we had to go eight blocks to school, church. And my dad would get out there and carry? one of my little sisters was crippled, and he would strap her on his back, you know, and carry her. And then break a trail for the rest of us. But we did, we always had a lot of snow, and if it wasn't for the snow, why we wouldn't have had any water, really. And then it's just been the last fifteen or twenty years when it started to get less and less until we had those big ones, you know. That was a dilly, ooh. Everybody's roofs cavin' in and every thing else. When was that?

EVA CAVENESS: Thirty-six wasn't it?

MARY SALA: No, it was one more recently.

SUSAN ROGERS: Sixty-eight? Sixty-three? Sixty-eight?

MARY SALA: That's when they flew that bunch in from <Texas>, you know, and let them down in a helicopter out here to clear off some of the government buildings out there by Lake Mary. That dome or whatever they got out there or research. I don't know what it is.

SUSAN ROGERS: On Anderson Mesa.

MARY SALA: Because the boys, well then it said there was going to be another one following it, so they stuck around. Instead of sitting around getting bored, why they went from house to house, you know, and got to shoveling off roofs because?

EVA CAVENESS: The theater caved in. Thank goodness there was nobody in that.

MARY SALA: Or what was it, the Red Cross building, too, wasn't it? Wasn't it at that time that that Riordan kid's new place out here some where?

EVA CAVENESS: Bob, was it Bob Riordan? (Ed: Joe Rirodan’s house)

MARY SALA: Fifty thousand dollar home. It caved in; the kitchen part. Oh, they had to shovel like the dickens. Especially these flat roofs, you know. Anybody builds a flat roof in this country is crazy. They ought to have A-frames.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now when you lived out at the ranch, did used to ever go up the San Francisco Peaks?

MARY SALA: I climbed that by foot when I was sixteen. From that point over there. And they had a fellow that was up there during the rainy season, you know. They didn't have these big towers and things. And my brother and I and another couple. He came down to the ranch maybe once a week or once every two weeks for eggs and different things. Or if we went to town to pick up things, and he'd come pick them up. So this one year my brother and I and this other couple walked back up with him. The first thing we walked up, he had his tent pitched within a quarter of a mile from the peak, and it began to rain like heck, and he didn't have anything much but even a pup tent. So we all tried to get in there to sleep. But the way he would signal, you know, from, I guess one mountain to another down in this area, or Kendrick Park, or whatever, he was flashing something. You know, it was just dot and dash with a big light. So, he was giving them what was going on up there in the light, he flashed them around. Well, it quit raining the next morning so we all climbed to the very tip. And I guess it was the highest one, which is what? Was it Humphrey or what? Now they ride up in automobiles and have ski lifts, and I don't regret that a minute. Boy that's quite a climb and you'd better have somebody in that thick forest who knows where they're going to from that area from the ranch?

EVA CAVENESS: Timberline.

MARY SALA: Walking. So that was the only way up there. But I enjoyed it.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now later on, they had that Weatherford Road going up there. Do you remember that? S and

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you used to go up it at all?

MARY SALA: Well they never did finish it. No, they got to fighting him, you know, would have finished it. Was it north of town or <Sedona> or what, fog? (Reference to fog moving in.)

SUSAN ROGERS: Looks like fog almost coming in.

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah, it's coming in like the mountain. You know we never used to have fogs like this _________.

MARY SALA: Oh, once in awhile, yeah, well it hasn't been too bad.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you make any trips down to <Oak Creek> when you were young?

EVA CAVENESS: We had to walk if we did. Not very often, I know I didn't.

MARY SALA: Gosh we didn't have any car until, oh, what was it, a Model T?

EVA CAVENESS: Yes, 'sixteen.

MARY SALA: Had to snap on the side curtains in the rain. I don't know, gosh. Let's see the only one I, I guess the first ___________ was that Brown(?) girl that had one. She didn't know much about?

EVA CAVENESS: Alice or Agnes, or _______?

MARY SALA: Agnes, Jo, they both worked at Babbitts'. And Warren used to take you guys to dances in there because they didn't know much about driving. So we had one like it, but remember when we bought that thing, or Dad. And I don't know whether we ever went to <Oak Creek>. But I know I went to <Phoenix> with friends, and it took us two days to get down there, you know. They stopped at a ranch house or something and stayed over night. Somebody would have shacks down there, you'd have to stay; and it was a dirt road. And we went down through <Chino Valley>. And I think, only we went down there once or twice while we were kids? well there wasn't any transportation period.

SUSAN ROGERS: Well, you were always up around the peaks, anyway.

MARY SALA: Well during the summer, certainly.

EVA CAVENESS: And, of course, here in the winter time we were going to school and here in the winter time you couldn't get off the mountain then.

MARY SALA: Well I think it was the weekend or something, or holiday or something that I went down with these people, spring or summer or something. Nobody went anywhere. And of course about the furthest they got with their football and basketball. I was on the basketball team in high school. We just go as far as <Williams> and <Winslow>, you know, by train. So that was really the only train.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you ever get up to the Grand Canyon?

MARY SALA: I did after, let's see, before I was married. Charles took Mother and I up there the first time. Now there were some transportation. Who wants to go a hundred miles horseback(?).

SUSAN ROGERS: Do you remember any famous people that visited <Flagstaff> or put any special performances put on?

MARY SALA: Well they took a movie up here, up here in this area at one time. Do you remember they took a movie, it was a snow scene or something? And they took the Hoffman house; not the interior, just the outside. Because, you know, they take these scenes fifteen different places. It's just according to what the atmosphere is.

EVA CAVENESS: I don't remember what that movie was, the name of?

MARY SALA: Well I can see, we come up to watch. And I can just see this man chasing the gal down the trail in the snow. And that's about all I remember. I don't remember what the name of it was. I don't know. I don't know, did Zane Grey ever come?

EVA CAVENESS: Maybe he did.

MARY SALA: I am trying to think who the dickens....

SUSAN ROGERS: How about Andy Devine? Did you know him?

MARY SALA: We went to school with Andy Devine.

SUSAN ROGERS: Did you?

MARY SALA: In fact he carried my sister's Cecilia's books home darn near every night from school. He kind of ran around with her. We all knew Andy Devine, the Devine family. I think he lived in <Williams> for awhile. And then came here, or was here and went to <Williams>, I think, at least part of the time. And look where he is now. Just because he could lisp or something.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. After you went to the parochial school, did you go from there to the high school?

MARY SALA and EVA CAVENESS: Yeah.

SUSAN ROGERS: Can you tell me a little bit about the high school, maybe?

MARY SALA: Two years down here, two years. First and second years down here at the Emerson. Third and fourth was up at what they call the "Teacher's College" or "Normal". "Teachers", well it was a Normal school, too. I guess it was "Normal" at that time. I don't know. Did you go to high school?

EVA CAVENESS: Went two years, that's all. Seemed like I worked.

MARY SALA: Well we all worked regardless. I played basketball and then take a shower real quick and then run down and go to Bender's. We all worked.

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah, we all worked.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now did you play basketball? this is at the college?

MARY SALA: High school, well yes, second and third.

EVA CAVENESS: I played at Nativity.

SUSAN ROGERS: Was girl's basketball quite a big thing in the community?

EVA CAVENESS: Susan Brent(?) was the instructor.

MARY SALA: Not on me.

EVA CAVENESS: Me.

MARY SALA: I don't care about you. (all laugh) What did you say? I didn't even know you played.

EVA CAVENESS: Oh gosh, yeah. I've got pictures of it.

SUSAN ROGERS: On girls' basketball?

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah, uh huh.

SUSAN ROGERS: Was this quite a big deal in <Flagstaff> at that time?

MARY SALA: Well that was about all, not much football. Baseball, the boys played baseball in high school. But the girls didn't have any of that stuff. My lord, we were like little ladies(?). Now look what they're doing today(?). I don't think there was even a swimming pool around.

EVA CAVENESS: No, I don't think so. We'd go out to mud holes.

MARY SALA: No, I'm talking about the college.

EVA CAVENESS: No, I don't think so.

MARY SALA: Until they built the one there, that's up there now in that area.

SUSAN ROGERS: Any other extra curricular activities you remember? Any plays put on, or anything like that?

EVA CAVENESS: Well what was that play for the end of school?

MARY SALA: Well they had, outsiders come in, they called the "Chautauqua". Don't you remember? That was shown up here at the Normal School. It was called the "Chautauqua". I don't know what they call them today, probably the operas.

SUSAN ROGERS: Would those people, you mean come in from out of town?

MARY SALA and EVA CAVENESS: Oh yeah.

MARY SALA: They called it the "Chautauqua".

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. And then do you want each tell me, you both worked. Do you want to tell me your separate stories from there through some of your working experiences?

MARY SALA: Well, tell them the places you worked.

EVA CAVENESS: I'm the oldest one of the gang, so I don't know.

MARY SALA: Trying to think what my first job, well it was babysitting for ten cents an hour; ten cents an evening. Sometimes you stayed all night. Now they get a dollar ten an hour.

EVA CAVENESS: Up here on the hill for some people, get fifty cents. Might wash the diapers or wash the dishes and clean the house while they were out some place. And then I'd walk on home, right down here to 723 W. Aspen. And I worked for the telephone company. And that was in the?

SUSAN ROGERS: How big was the telephone company at that time?

EVA CAVENESS: Not very many. Just the switchboard about that big. There was about one hundred calls, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now how many numbers? What I mean is when you dial a number you dial "seven".

EVA CAVENESS: And that's four parties on each line.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh.

MARY SALA: What was there really four numbers. There was no area code.

EVA CAVENESS: Oh no, no. No area code, no. Just four people on one line. You get two rings for two or, you know, whatever anybody called.

MARY SALA: One ring was yours and two was somebody elses; three was somebody elses. And then all four of 'em get on and listen to the gossip; fire.

EVA CAVENESS: Fire, we have a fire alarm for fire and for police. They were all separate. And number "nine" was police and "thirteen" was fire. Betsy Rosen(?) was my chief operator.

MARY SALA: Weren't you working there when you married and left <Chicago>? In other words you didn't have very many jobs.

EVA CAVENESS: No, I worked for the Confection Den, and I worked for, yeah, the Confection Den, candy and soda pop.

SUSAN ROGERS: Now was that place the hang out for the high school or the college kids or just everybody?

EVA CAVENESS: Oh, anybody who wanted to go in and get an ice cream soda or buy candy or anything like that. And also they had the bakery there. What's the name of the bakery?

MARY SALA: Keller's Bakery.

EVA CAVENESS: Keller's Bakery, yeah.

MARY SALA: Knoles. Now it's a Chinese?

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah. I wrapped bread in there, but that was _______.

SUSAN ROGERS: Let me back check a minute. When you were in high school, where was the place that the students would gather maybe? Where did you go on dates?

MARY SALA: Up here on the hill. Go on weinie roasts, you know. Or take hikes, you know, weekends, you know, out here around the mountains. Mt. Elden, that was, that area out there was wild. You could run into bears or anything else out there, you know. Now look at it, two legged animals run around now.

EVA CAVENESS: You wouldn't dare go into the woods now.

MARY SALA: No, we'd have weinie roasts. And then they'd have dances. They had dances up there at the University.

EVA CAVENESS: A lot of coasting here, skiing down this hill right out here. There was a lot of coasting.

MARY SALA: Sleigh riding.

EVA CAVENESS: Ice skating, over here at the pond, way out here by Black's Pond, whatever you want to call it.

MARY SALA: The City pond was there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Do you want to go back to your jobs then? Then how'd you meet your husband?

EVA CAVENESS: I met him here, and he was drafted.

MARY SALA: I don't know what he was doing. What was Joe doing?

EVA CAVENESS: He was at the pool hall; him and Jack.

MARY SALA: Fuss.

EVA CAVENESS: Had interest in the pool hall. And he was drafted and, of course, he went to his folks in <Chicago>, and then he sent for me later. Where he was going to be at Ft. Grant in <Chicago>, in <Illinois>. So then I went with his people. Just four months from the day he entered service, he was killed.

SUSAN ROGERS: Oh, my goodness.

EVA CAVENESS: And so, then I was pregnant with <Charlotte>, my oldest daughter. And then I came back to <Flagstaff>.

SUSAN ROGERS: You've lived here ever since. Now did you work again when you came back?

EVA CAVENESS: Oh yeah.

MARY SALA: Got married and had two kids from the other Brannon; married a brother.

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah, six years later I married his brother. And he's deceased. And then I married Mr. Cavaness, and that's about twenty-four years that he passed away. That will be ten years the eighth of April. So, I've been a widow ever since.

SUSAN ROGERS: So, how many children do you have all together?

EVA CAVENESS: Three, two girls and a boy.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. Now when you moved back to <Flagstaff> did you move into this house?

EVA CAVENESS: No. I was with Mother, at 723. And then after I got married to Mr. Cavaness, then we bought this. And I've been living here ever since.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. So what year was that? Did you build this house or did you buy it?

EVA CAVENESS: We bought it. We remodeled it. It was only two rooms.

MARY SALA: Belonged to the McKinneys, didn't it?

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah. It belonged to McKinneys, home. So that was it.

MARY SALA: Exciting, exciting.

SUSAN ROGERS: You want to tell me about you?

MARY SALA: Plenty. Let's see. What did I all do, my dear.

EVA CAVENESS: Oh, Mary.

MARY SALA: I waited tables, hashing as they called in those days. I worked at drug stores; jerked sodas. I worked Babbitts' Ready To Wear; I worked in their men's shop.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. You said you worked at Babbitts'.

EVA CAVENESS: Twenty-five years for Babbitts'.

MARY SALA: Well, that was since you came back.

EVA CAVENESS: Since I came back.

SUSAN ROGERS: And you're still working there now. What department do you work in now?

EVA CAVENESS: Ready To Wear. I can work in any of the departments, because I've worked in all of them at one time or other between the twenty-five years. But when I get this all healed up, they want me back.

MARY SALA: Continue, Mary Sala. (all laugh). I worked about ten years for J.C.Penney Company.

SUSAN ROGERS: Here in Flag, right?

MARY SALA: Here in Flag. We never left Flag. Oh, I was in <Phoenix> for awhile when I was first married. Then I worked in the butcher shop over here, that's Food Town now. What else did I do. Well I worked at the registrar's office for almost twenty-three years. My gosh, I worked on, I don't know, it seemed like that there was always something.

SUSAN ROGERS: You worked up on campus for twenty-three years, huh.

MARY SALA: Yeah, I worked up there.

SUSAN ROGERS: Where did you say you retired from there?

MARY SALA: Three years ago; be four years in July now.

SUSAN ROGERS: Can you think of any big changes, you saw happened up there?

EVA CAVENESS: I bet she has when she quit or retired.

MARY SALA: From the teachers, well it was a teachers; what was it, what they'd call a teacher's college?

SUSAN ROGERS: Yeah.

MARY SALA: And, of course, the University. I think it was "Teachers" when it went to University. And I've seen the president, what's his name, die. What's his name before this Walkup?

SUSAN ROGERS: Eastburn, you mean?

MARY SALA: Yeah. We used to have some great times there, too. It was just kind of like a big family, you know. And Eastburn would go hunting every year. He'd bring home an elk, a deer, or something. Then he'd have his kitchen roast it up, you know, in different help and all, and fed the whole bunch around there, you know, the instructors and office help. They use to have a lot of things going on like that.

And then once a year each office would get their gang together, the instructors, also, and they would put on little skits of their own and show them. I don't know if they ever took movies of those things or not, but they were some of the cutest darned things. And being more or less pertaining to the job you had in the different things that came up, you know, and you just made really comedy out of it. But I remember so many times. Well, usually Gillenwater and Faucet would put one on, and they were cards, I can tell you. They were good. And of course we'd always put on some crazy thing, the registrars, you know, about registration and a few things.

SUSAN ROGERS: I can imagine.

MARY SALA: And they were fun days. We'd have that hall packed, I'll tell you. But they were really fun days. We had a lot of fun up there. Then, oh dear, then it got so big, you know.

SUSAN ROGERS: You must have, saw a big enrollment increase.

MARY SALA: Well, yeah, I think there was only five hundred there when I went to work in thirty-five. And that was all registration, spring registration. And that's when we were getting the kids out of high school, you know. But, and then the equipment up there, my gosh, we went in the dark room, you know, and made a negative and then a positive of the whole registrars and such if someone wanted a transcript. And I did all that kind of work. I recorded all their work on their record cards, typed them on. You took the instructors' grades. He had one card where we put the grades down on each kid's card and then go back and pick up the grades _______ grades and all. Then you'd add up the hours and the points and the average, and boy we did everything. That registrar's office had registrar, secretary, myself, and maybe a couple of girls that helped us. And now they're setting on top of each other's lap up there. It was bad enough when I quit. Ooh!

SUSAN ROGERS: Now you can tell me about your marriage, how you met your husband.

MARY SALA: Well I was working in a restaurant, and he seen me in there and decided by durn he was going to get a job there, too. That's what he told me afterwards. "Seen me in there and by durn you were the girl for me." And of course I have two beautiful kids. He passed me(?), and then I married Sala; my first name was "Wilkerson". My youngsters' names are "Wilkerson". So and then the second man I married was a peachy peach. Boy he was great. He could keep house, hecould bake; he could cook. So I was spoiled, amen.

EVA CAVENESS: I think we both were spoiled.

MARY SALA: I think we both deserve something.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. I was just going to ask you a little bit. Did you ever get down to the south side; S. San Francisco St. at all? Do you remember its reputation then at all?

EVA CAVENESS: Once in a great while.

MARY SALA: Well, ah yeah. The Miguels had a Spanish restaurant over there. It was called "The Legion" wasn't it? The Miguels, boy, they haven't put out Spanish food since like it around here. It was made right from scratch.

EVA CAVENESS: This stuff here?

MARY SALA: She has passed away.

SUSAN ROGERS: I know she passed just a month ago; two months, maybe. 'Cause we had her down to interview.

MARY SALA: Did you have her down? That's good, I'm glad you did. She told you about her restaurant over there, I guess.

SUSAN ROGERS: Okay. I think that just about answers all my questions on that line here. Can you think of anything you want to add that I might have missed?

MARY SALA: Oh, I don't know.

SUSAN ROGERS: Want me to turn it off for a second and see if you see something else there, or something.

( begin searching through the papers)

MARY SALA: Oh, well Dad did a lot of garden plowing, too, you know, in the spring for people around here in this area. And if he came down from the mountain with nothing on the wagon, every kid out in that area would run out there for a ride, and he would stop and pick them up, and they just looked for him. And even today, you know, Dr. Gillenwater, at that time his kids were small and lived out there. Miz Gillenwater often said to me, she said I'll tell you those kids just loved Mr. Michelbach, 'cause they went out there and had all these rides. And he loved kids. He'd take kids on the sled. Well one year when he was around town just a bunch of little kids, and the horse went and fell and broke his leg. Those kids got off of that sled and just fell on that horse and cried, now. It was pitiful. You had no idea, because they had to put the horse away, you know. He had to be shot.

And I don't know; what else. You talk about Dad, and I really, we really had an angel of a mother.

SUSAN ROGERS: That's what I was saying, maybe you could tell me a little bit about your mother, too.

MARY SALA: Yeah, we didn't give you much on her, did we. Oh dear, shoot, my mother, my gosh.

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah.

MARY SALA: She was busy taking care of us, I'm sure. But then she never was too busy to help people, you know, and take in somebody. She worked awfully hard on that ranch. Well, this isn't too long.

(Reads from the obituary) "Mrs. Veronica Michelbach, widow of a well-known <Flagstaff> homestead rancher and one of the city's most beloved pioneer citizens, died here at the home of a daughter on Friday. Mrs. Michelbach, who turned ninety-five last August 10th, had been in ill health for several years, and had made her home with one of her daughters, Mrs. Mary Sala." That's when she died, and then they had the funeral mass. Now let's see what else. Then they gave when she was born. We've got that there, don't we.

EVA CAVENESS and SUSAN ROGER: Yes.

MARY SALA: "She came to the <United States>", you got that, and when they were married. Of course Mother came out here to Flag and followed "him in ninety-seven, where she first worked in the home of Mr. and Mrs. George Babbitt, Sr. And the couple was married here in January 5, 1898."

SUSAN ROGERS: Let me turn this tape over.

END TAPE 2, SIDE 1, BEGIN TAPE 2, SIDE 2

MARY SALA: "Many years they made their home <Flagstaff> in a house that stands, and you got that right, 723 W. Aspen Av. They also homesteaded the ranch on the western slopes of the <San Francisco Peaks> near Hart Prairie near Arizona Snow Bowl. And for many years spent summers living on the ranch and winters in <Flagstaff>." She got out in the field; she pitched hay; she picked up potatoes; she worked like a man. And these people from <Germany> were really hardy people, and they worked hard, and they did after being brought over here. Besides having eleven youngsters, she'd have one that was just barely walking and take us out in the field and stick them in a tub. And she had one under here, but it didn't kill her. We all were healthy. So ah, then it tells how many kids there were. "In her long life time in <Flagstaff>, Mrs. Michelbach was personally known as a devoted wife and mother. She was, however, a life long and active member of the Catholic Church here, able to recall days when the church's principal headquarters were a building on the city's south side _____ when the city is 'something' two parishes". Where the city is the site of three parishes, I guess is what they had. Three parishes over there now?

EVA CAVENESS: Yeah.

MARY SALA: "She was also member of the Rosary Altar Society at Nativity Catholic Church. And then she was preceded in death by a son, Joseph? <Flagstaff>." 'Course we got that and then _______ that he died, and then, of course, how many grandkids she had. But durn it, she had to make her own soap up there on the ranch. When an old cow died, she would have to bring up a baby calf on a bottle. She had to nurse sick chickens, setting hens. If the doggone things stole the nest somewhere else, and they had chickens, well we brought them in and put them under the kitchen stove to keep them warm. My mother was really something else. She made the sauerkraut she’d help, we'd stomp it for her. She was right out there with Dad. In fact she was right there, besides doing the cooking and washing clothes on a wash board. I remember, by durn, one Sunday when it rained hard, you know, we'd catch water in a little puddle dam, about, just below there, you know that lower field. So, it was a Sunday, and the sun came out, and it was pretty hot. So we said, "Mom, come on down and watch us swim." None of us could swim, and there wasn't enough water there anyway. So we got her a chair, we got her _______ (laughs). I can still see us walking her down there, you know. Us in just bloomers, you know. Getting down there just mud growin'. Because we had no way except that pond over there where we watered the cattle, and then there was a big hole in the middle. We didn't dare get out too far. We would go on down and never come up. But anyway that was something. But I can just, going down there, and she was sitting there watching us, like we was afraid we were going to drown in the mud, so she could pull us out. I don't know. Oh dear, I recall that so many times, you know, they just took her down there, and we were really going to show off. And all we had was mud, ah dear, I don't know dearie, I don't know.

Is anything else? I think that pretty well covered high lights, low lights or something, what ever was going on.
