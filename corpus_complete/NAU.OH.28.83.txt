KRISTINE PRENNACE: This is an interview with Mrs. Eunice Veazey who is a native of <Flagstaff> and has lived in the area off and on since her birth in 1905. She's the daughter of George Babbitt who is one of the five original Babbitt brothers who settled in <Flagstaff>. The interview is being conducted on July 29, 1976 at Mrs. Veazey's home, which is located at 412 E. David Drive in <Flagstaff> by Kristine Prennace representing the Flagstaff City/Coconino County Public Library.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, Mrs. Veazey, when and where were you born?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: <Flagstaff> in 1905, March 15, 1905.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: And, who were your parents?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: My father was George Babbitt.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: And your mother?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Was Philomena Wessel.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Where did she come from originally?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: My father was born in <Pittsfield Massachusetts>. And my mother was born in <Cincinnati Ohio>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: And they met in <Cincinnati>?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: And do you remember what year your father came to <Flagstaff>?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: He came before they were married… and I don't know for sure. Then he went back and they were married in 1887 and came right out here.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: So it was definitely in the early 1880s that…

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes, in 1887 they were married and came out here. They were married in June and came right out as a young couple.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: And what did your parents do? Well, what was your father's occupation?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Well, first he was a butcher here in town and then they organized… he's one of the Babbitt brothers and I don't know when they organized and started their business… you probably have that somewhere else, don't you?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yes, a lot of the specific information. But he actually was a butcher.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes, he worked as a butcher, I think here in town and then, they got money from the Verkamps and started the Babbitt Brothers.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did your mother work at all?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: No.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: She raised a family! You have brothers and sisters…

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes, I had three brothers and one sister.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What were their names?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Bertrand was my oldest brother, my sister came next - Margaret, and then Herbert, George, and myself, Eunice. I was the baby of the family.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now the only other one that's living still is George, Jr.?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Let's see, where did you receive some of your schooling?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Well, I went to St. Anthony's down here up until the 6th grade. Then I went to Immaculate Heart in <Hollywood> in a boarding school through high school. So, I don't know too much about the people around town 'cuz I was gone a lot.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well, you can probably remember some...did most of your brothers and sister receive the same type of education at St. Anthony's first and then…

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes, my brother went to Notre Dame, Bert; my sister went back to <Loretto Kentucky> to the Sisters of Loretta.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh that was where the Sisters of Loretta originated?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes that was the mother's house, <Loretto Kentucky>. And that's where she went to high school and then she transferred to Immaculate Heart for the last two years.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: So you received most of your high school education outside of <Flagstaff>.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes, in the early days we did. My older brother Herbert went to St. Mary's in <Kansas City> and George went up here to high school at the College. They had a high school there. Then he went over to the Jesuits in <Los Angeles>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Loyola?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Loyola - he finished at Loyola College.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you have daily chores as a child?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: I can't remember, no, I don't think I did. I don't remember as a little girl having any - but as I got older I took care of my room! Cleaned it up and things like that.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Your day might be to go to school and come home, and what would you do when you came home? Do you remember at all?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes, I remember I used to go down to the canyon. We lived up on the mesa here and I would go down to the canyon and play during the day a lot of the time. I can remember that they had a garden down there, the family did, and when I'd come home at night and go to bed, I'd hear the coyotes hollering.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, they were so close!

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: So close, and I'd say, "I'm never going down there again", but I did.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Wildlife that close to town!

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Oh yes, turkeys and deer we used to see.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, it was just your family that lived up in this area?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes, the George Babbitts, we had a big home right north of here.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Right on the edge?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Well, no more in the center. There's quite a mesa here and it was in the center, back north of this area. This belonged to my uncle, this area, to Dave Babbitt. My father had acreage on the other side.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: And they were the only two that owned land up in this area?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes, at that time.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well, you were just out in the middle of the woods then. It must have been beautiful.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: It was.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Then you'd look over into Switzer Canyon?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: No, it was quite a little ways. We'd have to walk, not too far. You couldn't see it right from the house.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Over like where Bertrand runs now?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes, a little more.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What were your parents' expectations for your school and your future lives? What were you supposed to do? Did they every convey that to you?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: No, we weren't under any pressure whatsoever. I wasn't, anyway, and I don't think my brothers and sister were either.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Just kind of be happy and do what you?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Well, yes. They didn't make an issue of what you're going to do except that they did want my brothers to get started in the sheep business. They'd set them up a time or two in sheep and cattle.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, so they went into ranching. Is that what your brothers did then?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Well, yes, off and on. My oldest brother took up a homestead near the <Grand Canyon> and that was quite a chore, you know.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, I can imagine - well, he was way out!

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Well, yes, he was way out.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did he have cattle or sheep?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Well, out on the homestead he didn't graze anything, just take up the land and improve it. Cattle was the main idea eventually, but I don't think he ever ran cattle out there.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, when did you marry then?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Oh dear… I think in '34. 1934. Isn't that awful?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: No…

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: No. That’s right, ’34.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: And who is your husband?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Isaac Fielding Veazey. V-e-a-z-e-y.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: And what did he do?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: He worked for the light company here. He was a salesman for the light company and he also took care--he was a mechanic I guess you'd say--he took care of washing machines, iceboxes, and things like that when they broke down.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: When did he come to <Flagstaff>?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: I don't know for sure, I think back in the '20s. He was born in <San Angelo Texas> and he came out here in the '20s. I should know what year he was born, but you don't need it do you?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: No that’s all right. And you had children?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: One son, Robert.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: And now, he was raised here in <Flagstaff>?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Does he still live here?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: He lives in <Scottsdale> now.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, what schools did he go to?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Well, he went here to St. Anthony's up until the 8th grade and then he went to St. John's Military Academy in <Los Angeles> for a year. Then he came back here and finished high school here. Then went up to the College here. He stayed here in <Flagstaff> most of the time.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: And what is he doing now?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: He's selling real estate in <Scottsdale>.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember as a child what the downtown area was like?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes, I do. Mostly boardwalks and of course, dirt streets. I guess there were a few cement sidewalks in front of the stores downtown, but the pavement didn't come till quite a bit later.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you get around on horseback as a child?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: As a child, we had cars. I remember a horse, a buggy. I can remember the old Catholic church, we belong to the Catholic faith, was way over there at Brannen homes, well, there's an apartment house there now, but the old Catholic church. We had a surrey and a horse as a little girl, I remember. And we went to church in a surrey and a horse.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember downtown seeing the horses just tied up outside?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: I don't remember that so much 'cuz cars came in pretty quick. I guess when I was about 10 or 12, we had automobiles. But we had the horses. A horse called Charley and another one called Gray, if that's interesting. Charley ran away one-day downtown right in front of Babbitts', no… he started by the Weatherford Hotel and he ran down Aspen, and we couldn't stop the poor animal. He was a nice horse, and my mother and a friend… the friend was driving, and a piece of the harness broke loose, and the faster he ran the harder it hit him. Finally it broke off and he stopped. But he ran about six blocks. The steps went down and I jumped out while he was going. Knocked me out.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did they have to take you to the doctor?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Well, they brought the doctor home that night. The doctor looked at me, but I was all right. You know the step was low, those surreys… and it looked like I could jump out and not hurt myself, so I did. I guess I was about 7 or 8 then.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember Front Street very well? Was it still pretty rough?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes, it was all saloons, mostly.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: You weren't supposed to go down, or…?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Oh, I don't remember being told not to, but I probably was, 'cuz I don't remember going on Front Street very much. We ran around town all the time and nobody thought anything about it, we weren't afraid of anything.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you know if there was a library?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: No, the first library I remember was up above… do you know where the bakery was?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, Keller's bakery?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes, but I don't know when that came, but that's the first one I remember. And Mrs. DeVaney was the librarian. You've heard of her, I guess.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Just--is she related to the DeVaney's that own the store up in the Plaza?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes, she was an aunt by marriage. She was married to...there was a Wally DeVaney… she was married to the other one.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: So the DeVaney's have been here a long time.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes, quite a while. They had a shoe store downtown. DeVaney's Bootery and one DeVaney was a butcher for Babbitts’ for years.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Are any of them still alive, do you know?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: The grandchildren are.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: The ones who are still…

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: …Running the store up here. It's the young boy that's the grandson; his father died. Young Wally DeVaney died a few years back.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well, now was the residential area fairly close to downtown?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Oh yes, but it started spreading. We moved up on the hill when I was three, 1908, but that was kind of one of the farther out houses. Then Dan Francis built the house that's where Mrs. Grasmoen lives. You know Ven Grasmoen? That was an early house Dan Francis built. There was a big family of Francis' here; they're old-timers, too.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: They were all inter-related, weren't they brothers? Like John…

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: There was John and Dan… and what was the doctor's name? There was a Dr. Francis and there was one out at <Mormon Lake>. I've always been poor at names. As I get older I’ve been getting worse!

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well geez you can remember where they were. So, you were up here on the hill. Was there anyone anywhere around? Was it all pretty much wooded land?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Didn't have any neighbors. Now when you lived… well, you were too little to remember when you lived downtown.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes, we lived on Cherry and Leroux. That's where I was born. It's vacant now; the old house was there for a long time and my brother owns that piece of property, George. That's where we lived and I don't remember much. I do remember a few incidents up on the hill. You know as we moved, but still I was 3 then, 1908.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember very much about the social life of the community?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Well, when I was young I don't, and then I went away to school, but, well, the different families would… as I remember when I was a little girl… the Riordan family would give a dance at least once in the summer and then I know my sister gave one up in our house. But they'd have dances like that and entertain that way, the people I knew. Now some of these other people had lots of other activities, but I don't remember any social activities.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, when you came back to town, settled down, got married - were there any club activities?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Oh, we had sewing clubs and we had bridge clubs and things like that. I belonged to a bridge club and I belonged to a sewing club. That was it. We didn't do a whole lot 'cuz we didn't have any money. My husband, our salary when we got married was $121 a month. Then we got a big raise of $5 a month. I'll never forget that. I heard we were getting a raise and I was all excited and then he got paid twice a month, see. So the first check had a $2.50 raise on it. Wasn't that something! But everything else corresponded, you know, the rent was $25 a month, butter 25 cents a pound, bread a dime or a nickel a loaf, eggs 25 cents a dozen. I can remember buying eggs for 25 cents a dozen, oh everything, coffee, everything was way down.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yes, so you probably had like a middle income.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Well no, it was not a middle income, a lower income.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: But you made ends meet.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: But we managed pretty well. We just didn't do a lot of things, didn't have money… you couldn't do them.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, do you remember much about the churches? You did talk about going to church. Did you say that was on the south?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: South side of town, yes. The first Catholic Church that they built was on… well, no a lot of people lived over on that end of town then. Brannen, an early doctor here, had a home over there. I think it's still there. Red brick house, and then they built the church over there. And it has since been torn down, can't remember what street it was one, but it was near O'Leary, if you know where O'Leary is. But that's where it was and it was quite a nice church. I don't know who built it. You've talked to Mary Switzer, haven't you?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: I haven't. Someone else…

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: She has all that church history she could tell you.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, I'm sure. So then, do you remember as a child going to church on this end? St. Anthony's was where Nativity is now.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes, uh huh. The first church down there was part of the school building. It was the Hall and it was just a temporary set-up and they used it for church for a long time. Yes, I remember going there, that's when I was going to school.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any of your teachers?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes, I remember a Sister Edwina and a Sister Viota (?). I couldn't tell you how to spell it, Viota. I remember them and then I left. That was in the fourth, fifth grade. Sixth, seventh and eighth was another Sister and I didn't have her 'cuz I left and went to the boarding school from the sixth grade on. So I didn’t have her. Sister Viota (?) and Sister Edwina are the two I remember.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any of your classmates?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Oh, sure. There were the Jakle, Mary Frances Jakle was in my class. Albert Michelbach was, and Frank Conrad was in my class, oh, there quite a few. Evelyn Rickle (?), she died as a young girl, a beautiful child, fifth grade I think she died. There was a girl Curtis, and there was a boy they called Frenchy, I don't know what his last name was, but he was a cute little kid. I remember that now. You know at the time you never think anything about it, but he was a cute little guy.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: He wasn't one of the Aubineaus?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: No. See they went to the public schools, and we went to the Catholic schools.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh huh, I was just wondering. I thought it was a French name, Frenchy.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: No, the Aubineaus, they're old-timers. I didn't know them, I just heard about them from my brothers and the name.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well that’s quite a few of your classmates!

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: You think so? Also, the Koch girls - Margaret Koch and Lucille Koch.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, their father worked at-

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: -the mill. The Riordans. They were in my class and the older girl died. I don't remember when, it was a sad situation, too. I think Margaret was in my class and Lucille a year later. They were in the same room. We had three grades in a room.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember going over to the Riordans very much? Were you related to them?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes, we're related. On my father's side. I think his mother was a Spellmire and the Riordan women, they were Metz. We're related to the Spellmires, I don't know if that's right or not. Then on our father's side, his mother was Spellmire and Riordan women's mother must have been a Spellmire, so through the Babbitt's we're related to the Riordans.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well you were a second or third cousin?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yeah, some kind once or twice, or three times removed. It’s a relationship, but sort of distant, I’d say.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well that must have been a long trip to visit them.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: No, I don't remember going there. I didn't play with them as a child at all. They were a little older and I was in-between. There was an older group that did a lot in the summertime, especially, that had a great time.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: When they were home from school.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes, and as I remember, they didn't all work then, they just vacationed. They didn't get jobs through the summers like the kids do now, like all the college and high school children do.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well, they didn't need to work!

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Evidently they didn't. But then there were some maybe that did, but the ones I knew didn't.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, this will probably be after you were married in the '30s, but do you remember anything about city government? Who was involved?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: No.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yes, a lot of people don't remember.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: I don't know. I know my brother was on Council once, Herbert. Oh, I shouldn't say that, I'm not sure.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: I think Herbert was on the Council at one time.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Well he ran for something. But I can't think right off about any of the others.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember World War I at all? You were pretty young.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes, I remember my brother, Bert, went off to the War. He was in the Service and I was on the coast and I can remember going down to the depot and saying good-bye to him. I was in boarding school and I can remember when the Armistice was signed, too.

END OF TAPE 1, SIDE 1, BEGIN TAPE 1, SIDE 2

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: …I remember when the stores were selling liquor, everybody was just buying everything they could. Everybody buying as much as they could afford. You know the ones that wanted to have liquor in their homes.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Just crate after crate.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: And I know we stored some of the wine with a friend in <California> and it blew up! They had it in the attic and it blew up.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Got too hot! Now do you have any memories of the Depression?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Oh yes that’s when we got married, in the Depression.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was that real hard for you?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Well that’s why the salary was so little and why everything was so cheap! I can't remember anything else except I think the country needs a good Depression now.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Get that inflation down.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: People don't know what it is to go without. All these young families and all these people on welfare. This Depression we had was quite different than what we've been going through because the government put up the money here. Before, they didn't do this, people were on their own, and just did the best they could. Now, there's workers compensation. If they're out of a job, why they get paid, it's quite different.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well, now do you remember World War II? Anything special?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes, I remember quite a bit about the rationing.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now did they ration a lot in <Flagstaff>?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Everybody had their ration books and we'd watch for things that would come at the store. Soap was a big problem, couldn't buy soap and when it did come in, you were only allowed to buy one pack of soap. Couldn't buy bacon - lots of things were scarce. One day we were playing cards at a friend's house and somebody came in and said "there's bacon at Pay and Take..." they used to call it, well, Safeway and the man across the street said what's all the excitement - is the War over? - And everybody said no, there's bacon! We all rushed down to buy bacon!

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember when the Ordnance Depot was put in?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Oh yes. That was really something, I guess. We had friends at <Bellemont> that we used to go and eat fish. They ran a little restaurant and they had a little motel, cabins, you know, and they had been out there struggling along for a long time and this Ordnance went in and they went to town. They had a wine and beer license and so many people tried to buy them out when they heard about <Bellemont> coming in. They'd come out and they'd think they didn't know about it and try to buy them out. Richardson was their name. Beletta (?) and I forget his name, but we were good friends, but after that came in we didn't go out there anymore to eat, 'cuz it was just a mess, I guess.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Crowded…

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Oh yes, and that one and only bar and all these… it was just packed to capacity all the time. So we just never went back to <Bellemont> after the Depot came in. We used to go out there and fish; there were some nice ponds out there.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh? They've probably dried up now…

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: No, I don't know what they were… artesian wells, I think. There was always water there and several ponds. I think they must still be there, but we don't go in there anymore like we used to.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yes, I didn't know there was water out there.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Oh yes, lots of water. That's one reason I think they chose that place because of the water and the dryness of the area. It was a good place for the ammunition.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, were there any big fires you remember as a child?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: No, I remember the mill, but I was older then, the mill caught on fire. The one that's gone now, ALandT. It burned one time, but they were always catching on fire, but that was a pretty bad one. You know; the sawdust piles would catch. But I can't remember any real big ones that destroyed anything. Oh, there was one on Front Street one time that was pretty bad, I guess, but nothing to get excited about.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: I think the one I'll probably always remember is the Commercial Hotel.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Well that was one of the bigger ones.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, do you remember any flooding?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: The year my son was born I was over on the coast, and they had lots of snow that year. I came home in March, I guess, and it rained on all this snow. And we went over to the south side, where South Beaver School is. It was all flooded, not bad, but, I guess about a foot of water running over from the dam and River de Flag running down. But you see the rain on top of the snow and it just didn't carry off. That must have been 1936-37. It was in ’37; spring of '37, March, April. Turned warm all at once.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, do you remember any dry years?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: That's all we've ever had were dry years!

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Where we had actual water shortages.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Oh, indeed. They'd haul water in from <Winslow> by train and pump it into the pipes. Everybody put big barrels and things under the eaves to catch rainwater and I can remember running out and catching the rainwater and coming in and flushing the toilets. We had water to bathe in and things like that, but you saved every bit you could. A lot of times you just didn't flush the toilet right away. And when it rained, you'd run out and get the water and come in and flush the toilets. I can remember that, all right. We had lots of water trouble through the years with <Flagstaff>. I think maybe it must be all right because people keep coming and we seem to have water.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: It's still a worry, I think.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Oh, yes it is. I think it could be done if they'd turn it over to private industry. (Laughter)

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, do you remember any big snow years?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes, that year it rained, that was a big snow year, that was '36-'37. That was when my son was born, that's why I remember that. And then they had another one - '48-'49 was a pretty good storm, and then when was that other one? That was the biggest one of all.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: The '60s?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: I think so. You've probably heard about that one. I don't remember what year it was. I was teaching school then and we were out for a whole week, I think, 'cuz of the snow. Couldn't get the streets clear.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, you taught school!

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Oh yes, 25 years.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, that is quite a while! Where did you teach?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: The first year was at <Sanders Arizona> -- Navajo Indians.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: That must have been interesting.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: It was--to teach them English.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: That must have been difficult.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Well, it wasn't if I had known what I was doing, but it was my first year. But it was interesting, it really was. Then I came here and taught the rest of the years here. I just taught one year at Sanders. But jobs were hard to get and you took what you could get at that time.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Like right now.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes, teachers are in over-supply again.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now you taught here. What did you teach--grade school?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes, I taught at South Beaver, kindergarten and second grade. Kindergarten for about six years and the rest, second grade.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, did you teach with- was Wilfred Killip teaching then?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: No, he was ahead of me. He had been principal in the high school when my son was there. Tommy Weitzel was the principal when I started and then we had several principals after that. I think it was sort of a proving ground for principals at South Beaver.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was it a pretty rough school?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Well, no. When I first started it was all Mexican children and then they integrated with the colored and sometimes it was kind of bad, but then…

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did the children get along together?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Oh yes, they did all right. Any trouble was mostly parents. You know what I mean? But they seem to get along all right, too. We didn't have too many difficulties really, I don't think.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: I didn't ask you about epidemics. Were there any epidemics?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Well, the worst one was the flu epidemic after the first World War, but I was over on the coast, but they said it was something, really something here. I was in school.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you catch it at all?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: No, didn't seem to. I was in <San Francisco> for one of them 'cuz was school was closed. See they closed all the schools and my mother was up there with my sister and her husband. So I went up there during the time it was closed and all I remember was that everybody wore masks. All these masks everybody wore.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well in the big cities I know it was really bad.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: I think they had all the theaters closed and things like that. Crowds, you know, they did away with all the crowds they could. Churches, too, I think they had… sometimes they didn't want people to gather in churches 'cuz of the crowds which seemed to make it worse, I guess.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember tourism? Has it always been in <Flagstaff> and has it always been…

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Well, in the early days, of course, people didn't travel much like they do now. They didn't have good roads, for one thing, and I suppose by horse and buggy you didn't go too many places. Tourism started, I guess, when they developed better roads and cars.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you ever as a child went out on the Babbitt ranches?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: No, we'd go out on Sundays every once in while, picnics and where they were rounding up cattle. We'd go to where the wagon was and have a Sunday dinner. I can remember doing that up in Hart Prairie one time. Well, we always got together on Sundays and had picnics more than anything else. We went out in the country somewhere and everybody liked their country here, you know?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: That's the attraction now.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes, I think it is.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well, did you ever go up to the Grand Canyon?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Oh yes, we went there quite a bit.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you take the train when you went?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: No, we drove the car as I remember. My mother always told about her trip - they had a stagecoach, you know, and she took it once because they were going to discontinue the stagecoach when the train, when the railroad came in. So she took one of the last trips on the stagecoach...

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, I bet that was interesting…

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: I bet it was, too. She and my father went and, of course, the road was in an entirely different place than it is now.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: It went around by Cameron?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Well, no, it went… well, you know if you've been out in the woods and you see some old posts that were the old road. I don't know if they're still there or not, but my brother's ranch near the Canyon where he homesteaded; there were some old posts there where it had gone through. It didn't go to <Cameron>; it went to where the main gate is now on the south side.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you start out going east around the Peaks? Instead of going west?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: I don't know for sure, I think they went west.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: It probably did.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: And there were several other roads. There was a road that went east of the Peaks, followed 89 kind of. It followed 89 for a while and branched off. Then we went to Grandview, it was a hotel and that was the Buggeln Ranch. We went there several times, it was right on the edge of the Canyon, they called it Grandview. I don't know who owns it now, I suppose the federal government has bought it. Buggeln's had it for a long time and there was a hotel sort of thing there at one time - I guess that was maybe before the El Tovar.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: It could've been - oh, did you ever go down in <Oak Creek>?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Oh yes.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was that a pretty wild ride?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Oh well, the first people went down on horseback as a rule and there was a trail - I don't know where it was - of course, all I remember is that first road down in there, which was pretty bad, but I was a little girl then. And they'd go down there and spend a week at Lolomai Lodge. There was a lodge down there that Mr. Sisson had built and I guess had taken it up or bought it… he owned that property anyhow, Sisson, and he built Lolomai Lodge. The young people would go down and spend a week or so. It was lots of fun.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, I bet. Was there anything at all out in east <Flagstaff>?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Greenlaw Mill. We'd take a ride in the evening and go out to the Greenlaw Mill and back, a lot of times. I can remember doing that in the car. The Greenlaws, you know owned one of the first cabins - where people could stay in cabins - there on 89 there to the left, where all the stores are now. Greenlaw took that up in there, I don't know whether they homesteaded it or what, but Greenlaw had a mill.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: They had a big ranch.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: I don't know about the ranch, all I can remember is the Greenlaw Mill! You've talked to those girls I guess, haven't you? Those women? I'd bet they'd remember a lot.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well, I didn't talk to them, someone else did. I guess they did.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Oh yes, I'm sure they did, because they're a little bit older than I am and stayed right in <Flagstaff> all the time, you know.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you ever know or see Zane Grey around town?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: No, I never saw him.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: He was here quite early. Did you know Lee Doyle?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Yes, I knew Lee Doyle.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: What kind of work did he do besides just going out in the woods? I always hear about that.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: As I remember, when the movie people came out here, he would supply horses and things and get busy and find things for them. He worked for them quite a bit… if they needed horses he'd get them for them. Things like that. That's what I remember him doing.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: So that may have been just about all he did do. Lead hunting parties out…

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: I don't know whether he was a guide or not. He probably was.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: He's an interesting person, though, I think.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: From what you've heard. Well, you could probably find somebody that would know about him. More than I do, I can remember his face and his build.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: He was quite old when you were…

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Oh, he wasn't so terribly old I don't think. How long has he been dead - do you know?

KRISTINE PRENNACE: For some reason I thought he was real old.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Lena Doyle… well, they're old timers. Lena Doyle was his sister. But I don't… and I remember that house. It's too bad they tore those homes down, it made me sick. There were three beautiful rock houses on that block where the Whistle Stop is now.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: They were very large homes?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Quite large. Two stories, straight up and Lee Doyle owned one of those on the corner that his family had owned. And I think he owned the next one and the other was owned by Hensing (?) or Walters.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: They were like natural stone houses?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: No, red brick.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, red brick, how pretty.

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Oh, they were.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember much about the University and how it's changed?

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: Oh, it's really changed, all right. I went there through the summer every once in a while for summer school when I was… Well I went to the University, and through the summer I'd come up and maybe take a course or two. It started out as a Normal School, of course, and just grew. The Second World War they used it as a training for - was it the Navy? Seems to me it was a Navy training set-up and from then on it seems to keep growing.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, I can't think of anything else specifically to ask you - can you think of anything…

EUNICE BABBITT VEAZEY: I think you've done real well, myself.
