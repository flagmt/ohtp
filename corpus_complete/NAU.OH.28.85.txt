CBW=Charles B. Wilson KP=Kristine Prennace 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, Mr. Wilson, when and where were you born? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: I was born in <Flagstaff> on September 14, 1913. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: And who were your parents? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: My father was C.B. Wilson, and my mother was Katharine Mars Wilson. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Is Mars Hill named after her family? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: No, it isn't. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Or… that's after the planet? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Yes. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, and where were your parents from originally? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: My father was born in <Monmouth Illinois>, and my mother in <Galesburg Illinois>. They came out here in 1910, to <Flagstaff>. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Ah, yes, so they were pretty early. Why did they come to this area? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Well, my mother's father got some ranch property down at <Glendale>, and they first came out to farm it. They were down there for about a year, and then my father decided to come up here and practice law. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Had he always been an attorney then? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Well, he hadn't been an attorney very long at that time. He had practiced law some in <Chicago>. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What part of <Flagstaff> did they end up settling in… their residence? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: It's where the First Federal Building is now, at, I think 20 East Birch Street. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, yeah, so they were right downtown then. 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Yeah and there wasn't much else around, because the town was pretty small. And he built an office building on the corner there, where the First Federal parking lot is now, which was next door to where he lived. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, uh-huh. (inaudible) Did your mother ever work, or did she just take care of the family? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: No, she didn't. She was a housewife. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you have any other brothers or sisters? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Yes, I had a younger brother. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was his name? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: James Mars(?) Wilson. We were both born in that house over there. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: The one that you're living in now? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: No, no, the one that my folks moved in downtown. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. Keeping it straight. So then your father practiced out here for how long? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Well, from 1910 'til the time of his death in 1964. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: That's a long practice! Oh, what year was he born? I didn't get that. 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Eighteen seventy-seven [1877], I think. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Boy that was a long time. I imagine your family knew the Golds very well? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Oh, sure, yeah. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: He's another… Well, did he come before your father to <Flagstaff>? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: No. I don't know when he came out here, but he was in <Williams> before he came to <Flagstaff>. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: (inaudible)… before. I think they came about the same time. Okay, where did you receive most of your schooling? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Well, through high school here in <Flagstaff>. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: The Emerson School? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: I went to the Emerson School and I went to what they used to call the training school, which is now the college elementary school. I went there for two or three years. Then I went to the old Flagstaff High School, which was new then. I graduated from Flagstaff High School in 1930. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: That was one of the first few classes that did graduate. 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Yeah. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any of your classmates, like at Emerson School? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Oh, yeah, I remember quite a few of the people that I was in school with. There were the Runkes and the Switzers, Jim Beard, who's still around here. Taylors - Bob Taylor's boys. He was an old-timer here. I don't remember offhand who else there was that would still be around. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah that’s pretty good. Well, Jim Beard now, he's related to Colonel Breen, wasn't he? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Uh-huh. I believe his mother was Colonel Breen's sister. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. And who was teaching at Emerson about the time that you were going to school? if you remember that. 



CHARLES B. WILSON: I don't remember. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was Laura (sic) [Lura] Kinsey still around at all? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Yeah, she was here. The ones that I remember over at the college were Mary G. Boyer, who was quite an outstanding woman - wrote a book on Arizona's Dark and Bloody Ground, and so on. Oh, I think the principal down there was a fellow by the name of Richardson, and then John Q. Thomas came in while I was there. And he was the principal and superintendent here for many years. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was Miss Boyer, or Mrs. Boyer a student teacher at the time? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: No, no, she was a supervisor in charge of some department over there, I don't know. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: You had a lot of student teachers then, teaching? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Yeah. Well, quite a few. The college wasn't too big then, either. I remember a lot of things about the early days when we lived downtown here. My dad was the first county attorney of <Coconino County>, when <Arizona> became a state. A lot of the old trials. Some of 'em were pretty exciting. I used to sneak into the courtroom and watch him sometimes. But it was all dirt streets here then, and wood sidewalks, board sidewalks. I remember during one of the notorious trials there were a couple of guys up for murder, and the town got real full of people from both factions, and everything was pretty touchy. They tried to kidnap my mother and I one night. We were coming home from visiting a fellow who lived just the other side of River de Flag. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: They didn't succeed then? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: No. No, we ran back to the house, and he strapped on his gun and walked us home. It was pretty interesting in those days. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, yes! Can you remember any of the other trials? That's very interesting. 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Oh, yeah, but I can't remember the names involved. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, just some of the circumstances? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Yeah. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were there many murder trials? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Oh, quite a few. Dr. Tom Manning was county physician and he and my dad used to go out in the middle of the night - almost every weekend somebody'd get killed, either here or in <Williams>. Once in a while he'd have to go up to <Fredonia>. The old <Lee's Ferry> sunk, you know, and to get to <Fredonia> in his own county, he'd have to go by train over to <Bakersfield> and then back up to someplace in <Utah> and down to <Kanab>. Long trip! 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: (laughs) That’d be several days! Oh, gee. That's really interesting. Well, like Front Street and that area was still pretty Wild West, wasn't it? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Oh, yeah. Yeah, it was. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Was that where most of the murders… 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Most of the action? 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah. (laughs) 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Yeah that’s where most of the action was. Of course we had Prohibition here, and so they were always involved in raids on bootleggers, and most of the places on Front Street sold liquor pretty openly. There was always a hassle goin' on back and forth between the people that went along with it and the people that didn't. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were there many bootleggers that were prosecuted then? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: No, not very many. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: I imagine there were a lot of civil suits also - do you think, compared to today? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Oh, nothin' like today, no. No, people didn't have their rights violated in those days like they do anymore. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well, they settled a lot of things out of court, too. 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Yeah! (laughter) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were there many problems between the cattle ranchers and the sheepmen that ever came to court that you knew of? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: No, I don't think so, not that I remember. It was almost impossible to convict a cattle rustler, because prit near every man on the jury had gotten his start that way in the cattle business. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah that does bring up a problem. What type of people made up the juries at that time, as compared to today? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Well, just the local people. There'd always be a few ranchers on there. They'd be real mad at the cattle rustler, but on the other hand they'd get to thinking back and decide maybe they were probably guilty of the same thing themselves at one time or another. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: It was registered voters at that time, also, is where they drew the jury from. Because I was thinking, were women involved in the juries? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: No, I don't remember any women. I don't remember when they changed the laws on the juries, but I don't remember ever seeing a woman on a jury in those days. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: That's interesting. Okay, let's see, I'd like to find out more about the legal work in <Flagstaff>. Can you think of anything that was particularly interesting? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: No. I'm not sure just what you want to know. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, maybe I'll think of a direct question in just a few minutes. Okay, after you went to high school, did you go right on to college? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Yeah, I went to college at Park College in <Missouri> for a couple of years, and then I went to law school at the University of Arizona. At that time you didn't have to have a degree to get into law school. So I went to college two years and then went to law school. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did your father actually have a law degree? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: No. He studied in night school back in <Illinois>, and eventually learned enough to pass the bar back there, just on his own. In those days you didn't have to have a law degree to practice law. (tape turned off and on) Here in those days you could either go to law school or you could study under a lawyer for a certain length of time, and then he'd certify that you had done this, and then you could go take the bar exam. I mean, I'm not talking about a real long time ago, I'm talking about even after I started practicing law it was that way. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, so it's just been recently. When did you start? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: I started in 1935. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: You just went into practice with your father then? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Uh-huh. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, let me see. Okay, did you marry? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Yeah, I got married the last year I was in law school, 1935. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What's your wife's name? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Her name was Allie, A L L I E, Allie Kathleen Tanner. I met her when I was going to school in <Missouri> - she lived there. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: And did you have any children? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Yeah, we had one daughter, who now lives in <California>, and she's a psychologist. My wife died in 1949. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was your daughter's name? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Frankie Katharine. She was named after her two grandmothers. Katharine's K A T H A R I N E. That's the way my mother spelled it. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: You don't see it that way very much anymore. 



CHARLES B. WILSON: No. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well, let me see do you remember many of the personalities in town? Maggie Pulliam, do you remember much about him? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Oh, yeah, I knew Maggie real well. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What was his position with the city? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: I called him city clerk. He was also city magistrate. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Is that similar to the city manager today? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Well, not really in a title-wise, but he pretty well ran the city. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, he came real early, about the time your father… 



CHARLES B. WILSON: I don't know when he came. He was here ever since I can remember. His father was here, too, T.E. Pulliam. 



I knew Tom Pollock, Old Tom Pollock. I knew Colonel Breen. Al Beasley that founded East <Flagstaff>. Alf Dickinson. Of course Billy Switzer was here. And Andy Matson. Then later Vic Watson, I knew him pretty well. And the Lockett family - Bob and Clay Lockett's father - I knew him. He died a lot of years ago, but I knew their mother real well. Dr. Raymond. Ramon Aso, we knew him real well. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What did he do? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: He was a sheepman, A S O. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Are any of his family still around? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: His widow's alive. He's got a son that I think works for the highway department. I didn't know any of the family. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Her name wasn't Cuba, was it? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: That was his second wife. That's the one he was married to when he died. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: I see, 'cause I had her name and didn't know who she was connected to. I don't know was Sandy Donahue gone by the time you could remember? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: I don't remember Sandy Donahue. I remember lots of things ABOUT him, but I don't place him personally. John Parsons, who was sheriff, as I remember - that's Dirk McKinney's [phonetic spelling] father-in-law. And of course I knew lots of Babbitts and Riordans. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Did you ever hear any stories or know that your father had any contact with Zane Grey at all? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Not that I know of. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: You don't remember anything particularly. Was it Al Doyle? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Lee Doyle was the one that used to live over here where this Babbitt Thriftway was. They've changed it to something else. I used to work for Lee Doyle, I used to drive a truck for him, and HE used to take Zane Grey around. He furnished transportation and horses for the old movie outfits that used to come in here in the thirties, and I used to drive a truck. We'd have to go set up camps for 'em. I used to drive truck down the old Schnebly Hill road, which was pretty spooky. Lots of nights we wouldn't even get out of our truck, we'd just curl up in the cab and sleep, and you ate when you could. He paid well. Every month we lined up at the window and got one hundred silver dollars. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh (laughs) that was pretty good. Did he ever have any other kind of job? Or was that mainly… 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Lee? 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah. 



CHARLES B. WILSON: That's all I ever knew of him doin'. He used to own that movie horse, Rex, King of Wild Horses - real famous horse. He kept it over there. It was a bad horse; it hurt quite a few people. It'd attack you, you know. You couldn't ride it. It was just strictly a movie horse. They had doubles for everything it had to do where people were involved. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember any of the movies you helped set up for? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: I think there was one called Smoky, a story about a horse. And one of the Zane Grey pictures. I think it was Riders of the Purple Sage, but I'm not sure. We'd have to stay and work during the whole thing, 'cause we'd have to haul horses and help out whatever we could. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, maybe I have you confused with someone else, but do you own property out by the Peaks, out in the Hart Prairie area? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: No. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, okay, I do have you mixed up with someone else then. Let's see do you remember much about the social life of the community? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Well, you mean when I was little, when I was real small? 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Well, yeah, what your parents did. 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Well, my mother used to bring me over across here to the Masonic Temple to Eastern Star potlucks and parties. I remember that. I don't remember a whole lot of social life. She used to love to play cards - my dad never did - so she was always goin' to card parties. We had a lot of family social life. We'd go out on picnics and in the fall we'd get together two or three families and go out someplace where there was canyons and wild grapes and the women would gather wild grapes and elderberries and the men and the boys would shoot rabbits and lay in a supply. We'd spend two, three days doing that. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Your father must have belonged to the Masons. 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Oh, yeah. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Were there any other organizations that you remember? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Rotary Club. He was one of the founders of the Rotary Club here. I remember he used to take me to Rotary once in a while when they met down in the basement of the Weatherford Hotel. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh! I didn't know where their meeting place had been. Let me see there was something… 



CHARLES B. WILSON: He was real active in trying to raise money to build the Monte Vista Hotel. That used to be a vacant lot over there, and I remember the local National Guard unit had a field artillery unit. They used to set up their guns there in that vacant lot and shoot at a target up on Mount Elden once in a while. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh, my gosh! Really right in town, doing that! 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Yeah. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Now, the Monte Vista was owned by different members in the community. 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Well, yeah, it started out, they sold stock to everybody, almost all-local people. That's how they financed it. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: So your father was involved as a stockholder then? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Yeah. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Do you remember much about World War I? You were awfully little. 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Yeah. Well, I just remember hearing about it. My dad was anxious to go. First, he was too old; and then he got the flu during that bad epidemic and almost died. I remember when the war was over, I remember him burnin' the kaiser in effigy on Babbitts' garage building across from where we lived. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: We talked a little bit about Prohibition. Do you remember anything else particularly, vividly about the Prohibition period? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: No, except that bootleg whiskey was so expensive. Most of it wasn't much good. It'd kind of eat the enamel off your teeth, some of it. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: What about the Depression? Do you remember how that hit your family or the community? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Yeah. Well, we didn't really have it near as bad here as they did in the Middle West. I was in the Middle West, going to school about that time, and it was really bad back there. It was really bad. I just couldn't believe the prices of things back there. You get a quart of milk that was half cream for a nickel. Restaurants in the cities with big signs, "All you can eat for thirty-five cents," and they meant it, too. You could go in there and just eat all you could hold for thirty-five cents, if you could find thirty-five cents. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Right. Yeah, that was the hard thing. 



CHARLES B. WILSON: I was workin' my way through school back there. I was doin' all right because I always had a pocketful of silver dollars that Lee Doyle had paid me before I went back. But it was pretty rough. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Wow. Well, how expensive was school, then, too? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Well, down at the university, it used to cost me approximately $600 a year, including board and room and tuition and books and clothing and everything. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: That was a lot to come up with, though, [at that time]. Okay, and what about World War II? You were back in <Flagstaff> at that time, during World War II? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Well, I was gone during World War II, I was in the Navy. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Oh! Okay, so you did serve. 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Yeah, I was in the Navy, I was a gunnery officer. I was on the Essex, mostly in the Pacific and then later on the Randolph. Well, I was in practically all the action there was out there. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: In the Pacific. Okay. Do you remember any big snows very well? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Yeah, I remember several. The biggest one I remember was that one in '49 when we had about fourteen feet of snow. But I think the worst one I remember was in the winter of '36 and '37. I just had moved into my new house up on the hill, and it snowed a couple of feet, and then it rained, and then it snowed two or three more feet. And we ended up with about five feet of snow and about six inches of ice right in the middle of it, and then it turned cold, just stayed cold. It was below zero every day, seemed like forever. The cattle couldn't get through that stuff to get to any feed, and they were droppin' hay all over everyplace. The game suffered. I was havin' to walk to work for several weeks - they couldn't get the streets opened up. Of course they used to have some plows. They had some big timbers in a "V" with a bunch of rocks piled on top - had a platform on 'em, and then they'd pull it with horses and mules. It wasn't quite as adequate as it is [now]. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: It was very hard then to drive any cars around (



CHARLES B. WILSON: Yeah.) 



KRISTINE PRENNACE:during the winter. Pretty slick. Okay, let me see. Do you remember much about East <Flagstaff>, what it was like? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Yeah, there was just practically nothin' out there. About where… that club that used to be the Saguaro Club… About there, there used to be a farmer out there by the name of Johnson, had a huge barn there. He raised potatoes in all of that area. He had a couple of kids that I used to go out and play with. And then there on Fourth Street was the old Greenlaw property. He had a little ol' sawmill. There was nothin'… nobody lived out there, except some farmers. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: This Johnson family - was Swede Johnson in that family? Or was that a different family? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: You mean the Swede Johnson that's here? (



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Yeah.) No.

KRISTINE PRENNACE: _________. 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Rather practice law. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay. Do you remember what <Flagstaff>'s position was in relation to the rest of <Arizona>? Like how much influence did <Phoenix> press on <Flagstaff> politics? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: Well, I don't think they influenced <Flagstaff> politics, but <Flagstaff> sure didn't have any influence. <Phoenix> has always run the state. Of course <Flagstaff> was not nearly as big, in proportion to the other Northern <Arizona> towns then, as it is now, either. It wasn't much bigger than <Williams>, and I think <Jerome> was bigger than <Flagstaff>. Winslow was as big, if not bigger. <Prescott> was bigger. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Okay, I can't think of anything else specifically to ask you. Is there any other really sharp vivid memory that you'd like to say? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: I don't know of anything that would be interesting to anybody. In 1951 I married Evelyn Gertrude Leem [or maybe Mead (Tr.)], who's my wife now. She had a daughter by a previous marriage. We adopted a son. Her daughter was named Carol and our adopted son, who lives here now, is Thomas Joseph Wilson. 



KRISTINE PRENNACE: Is your wife from <Flagstaff>, or some other area? 



CHARLES B. WILSON: No, she was originally from <Canada>, <Toronto>. Then I guess she was raised in <Chicago>, or vicinity. Then she was in <California>. She came here from <California>. I met her here.
