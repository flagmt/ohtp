[BEGIN SIDE 1] 

This is Brad Cole from Northern Arizona University. It's August 12, 1998. We're in the home of J. B. Tanner in <Farmington New Mexico>. We're going to speak with Mr. Tanner about his experiences as a Navajo Indian trader. Also present in the room is Karen Underhill, and Lew Steiger running the camera equipment. 

Cole: J. B., let's start with when and where you were born. 

Tanner: Well, that was a miracle in itself, Brad. When Mom and Dad got married, you would have thought that he would have been on the reservation at some store. But they moved to Mesa, and I wouldn't be here to talk to you if they hadn't of, 'cause I was born premature. I only weighed about three-and-a-half pounds. That was August 24, 1924, that I was born. They had to feed me with an eyedropper and put me in an incubator, which they had down in <Phoenix>, and they didn't have it here in <Farmington>. So that's what I meant, I wouldn't be here. So God works in mysterious ways, even back then. That's when I was born, and I was born in <Phoenix Arizona>. 

Cole: Who were your parents? 

Tanner: Rulel [phonetic spelling] Tanner, better known as Chunky Tanner; and Stella McGee Tanner. They both belong to the Mormon Church, the LDS Church. Her brothers and my dad's brothers, the whole families participated in one way or another, dealing with the Navajo people. And after we were--I think I was two- and-a-half years old, I'm not sure on that. I should have found out when I knew I was going to do this. Anyway, they moved back up here and Progressive Mercantile put Dad out here at <Montezuma Creek>. And I was sick from the day, all that time I was in <Phoenix>, and I just barely stayed alive. That was another miracle. At <Montezuma Creek>, there was a medicine man down there. Dad and Mom told him that I was born premature and all this and that, and he said, "I'll fix it." So he brought 'em a milk goat. He said, "Feed him this goat milk instead of whatever it is you're feedin' him, and within a month he'll be all right." And sure enough, it worked. So I guess that goat's milk was pretty powerful. But that's where they come from, Mesa, and was here and [herding?] this Progressive Mercantile down here at <Fruitland>. It was a wholesale warehouse. They owned several stores on the reservation, and they put various guys on it and give 'em a chance to buy 'em.

Dad first went to <Montezuma Creek> and was there two years and done real well. Progressive Mercantile bought Stya, over here on the road to <Crownpoint> from <Farmington>. That's a paved road now, but back then it was just two tracks. They had 5,000-6,000 head of sheep and a trading post, and they wanted Dad to go out there and run, 'cause he had done so good at <Montezuma Creek>. My dad, as I started to go with him, I was so small that it was hard--he didn't want me to be self- conscious that I couldn't do anything. So he managed to come up with some of the darnedest jobs. He'd just come up and tell me to go do this, whatever it was. He knew I'd figure out how to do it. But I'll get into that more as we go along.

Could we have a break? And I need to ask you, is this the way you want me to do? 

Cole: You're doin' fine. 

Tanner: Just keep goin'? 

Cole: Yeah. 

Tanner: The Navajo business was Mom, she more or less with the guy that Dad had there at the store--they run the store. He and I took care of the sheep and all the Navajo sheepherders moved camp and all. So to get me to have confidence in myself--that's what I meant, that he'd give me these odd jobs. For instance, my brother Bob was two years younger than I, and he was even a little taller than I was, because I got such a bad start. So he said, "Take that hay wagon and go load those corner posts," big cedar poles. Back then you had to have a stretch post, they called it, and then when the fence turned, that was a corner post. But in between, you'd have to have stretchers, I think, just about every hundred yards or so. He said, "You can tell, when you get them loaded, where the big holes are. That's where you drop these." _______ sides up, and Brad, there was no way that two kids could load those. Those posts were just too big. So he come into me right quick. I said, "Bob, unhook that white horse and put it goin' around on the other side, left side, of the wagon." While he was doin' that, I got one of these small ______ poles and pulled it around there. When he got the horse over there, he come over and helped me put that small end up on the wagon. Then we done another post, about that far apart, and put it up. Then we took this rope and the skids were here, and a big sack here, and we skidded 'em all up on there. It was real simple, it worked, (chuckles) got 'em all on. And then when we come to these places he wanted 'em dropped, it was easy to roll 'em off, and just roll one off. Every time Dad would get a chance, he'd tell that story. He said, "Those damned kids would figure out anything!" So I _______ in on that one.

You have to castrate the lambs and cut their tails off. Otherwise, they stay bucks. Buck lambs, you have to castrate 'em and cut the tail off. When you do, blood just goes all over. Dad said, "You think you can do that? These Navajos are kinda slow." So he got me a bandanna and tied it around (chuckles) my head, and he got a five-gallon bucket and put it there for me to get up on and stand on it. And they take these lambs and hold two legs--front leg and back--and just kind of spread 'em apart where I'd cut off of the bag, cut it off with those [nuts?] and I'd go down and pull 'em off with my teeth. (laughter) Dad used to tell that story. You can do five lambs while you're tryin' to get 'em out on one. Anyway, he just rode off after he set that bucket up. When he come back, boy, we had 'em goin'. And the ewe lambs, that's all we had to do, was just cut their tail off and mark their ears--cut a notch out of the ear. The others, we had to de-nut 'em. And that blood's all over me, and this bandanna was red. They called 'em Rocky Mountain oysters. That's quite a delicate breakfast to have, Rocky Mountain oysters and eggs. You know, you have steak 'n eggs, and ham 'n eggs. We almost looked forward to spring, when we could have--Dad would, after we cleaned 'em all, he'd put 'em in salt brine, salt water, and keep 'em down in the basement. They'd stay good for about a week, until it started to get warm. But things like that, he'd do.

And Granddad, he noticed when I was talkin' to the Navajo kids alone, I was the oldest in the family, so it was kinda hard, 'cause they couldn't talk English. But when my Granddad seen us havin' trouble learnin', bein' as we couldn't talk back and forth, and tell 'em, "Oh, this means that. Yá’át’ééh means 'hello,'" and so forth. So he asked Dad if he could take me to <Bisbee>. My Granddad was known for the best turquoise that was ever mined. It was down at <Bisbee>, and I don't know whether you guys have seen any <Bisbee> turquoise now, that come out of that copper mine that was down there. That's where turquoise come from, is in your copper mines. It's zinc and copper mixed, if it got to a certain temperature, everything erupted, and turquoise come in pockets. That <Bisbee> mine produced some of the prettiest spider web and blue, and then there was some green. But we'd go down there to his mine--he had a mine separate from, that he went back into a hill there, before that copper mine was even started, then was able to get more of it. But we'd bring the turquoise back to <Santo Domingo>, between <Santa Fe> and <Albuquerque>, and leave a bunch of turquoise there in the rough, and they would cut 'em and grind 'em and make those [jatos? conchos?], you know, that they have on the [otoman?]. Then white people make a choker out of 'em. Most of those have been one time or another, like Dad pawned, and most of 'em's gone, but you'll see some of these Navajo still wear some of those old <Bisbee> _______. But while we were doin' all that, then we'd go to <Zuni> and leave turquoise there, and silver, so that they could make Navajo-type jewelry for him, particularly belts and bigger bracelets. And then we would go back to <Crownpoint> and then down to <White Rock> where he stayed. He had quite a few Navajo silversmiths from <Crownpoint> all the way over to <Bisti> and <Tsaya>. They would make up jewelry.

Once we got this cycle goin', and all this time he's talkin' Navajo to me. In a matter of six months, I started to learn pretty good. I never will forget, I wasn't big enough to do anything hardly, and wherever the sun went down, he'd stop that pickup and get the bedrolls out, and we'd just have supper and go to bed. And then just before daylight, he'd let a holler out of him, for me to get up, in Navajo, and make his coffee, "Nídii'néehgo ahwééh shá 'ánílééh!" And that's what that means, "Get up and make my coffee!" (laughter) So I look back on it, it's really amazing how all this stuff happened.

So then it was gettin' goin' with him on about three years, on that turquoise thing. It wasn't a continuous thing. Whenever he was ready to make the run, and then each time we'd pick up jaclas after that first one, they'd have stuff for him each time. Then we'd go to <Window Rock> and out here at Crystal, where Chee Dodge lived. And we'd always give Chee Dodge the first pick-- spread it all out there and him and his family would pick out what they wanted. And then we'd just trade all over for horses and sheep and cattle. Then we'd drive 'em off at <Newcomb>'s, come across around <Newcomb>, <Sheep Springs>, and bring 'em over to <White Rock>. And then he'd start 'em up and we'd take 'em on up through and ship the cattle and ship the lambs. But he'd rather do that, than stay in the trading post. Before I was born, one of his kids or something, why, he was down here at <Shiprock>, and here at <Hogback>. And then he got that homestead he had at <White Rock>. He wanted that, because there were silversmiths out in that area, to do what I just talked about.

But then it was about time for me to start to gettin' a little education. To start with, Dad and Mom hired a woman as a teacher, [who] taught Bob and Dorothy. My family was seven boys and one girl. I was the oldest, and Bob and Dorothy was the [second and] third. And this lady taught the three of us. Mom got to worryin' about [Bob?]. The first thing you know, we'd be behind everybody, better take us in. So they brought us in. I think it was one or two years out there. We stayed with her folks, Grandpa Elwood McGee and Grandma McGee, and went to school.

Down here at <Waterflow>, kind of movin' on _________ there was a liquor outlet--Walt Stallings had it--and him and Dad was really good friends. And so out there in the summer, I'd tell Dad when we'd go to these dances and everything, I was self-conscious about bein' shorter than the girls, and I could dance better if I could have a few drinks, you know. So at any rate, he fixed it up with Walter Stallings, and whenever I come in after anything, it was for him. So about six months later, Dad and I would come in, and we come into <Newcomb>, instead of this way the road was bad, into <Newcomb>'s, we come by Walt Stallings down here, and went in and old Walt said, "Damn, Chunk, I'm glad to see you!" He said, "How come?" He said, "Well, I thought you were drinkin' yourself to death!" Boy, I knew I was in trouble! So Dad orders a couple of beers and a bottle of whiskey, and he opened it like that and handed it to me, and I said, "I don't believe I want any." He said, "Well, from what Walt says here, you've been carryin' it out of here. If you're gonna drink, I want you to drink with me when I take a drink, 'cause I won't overdo it." And Granddad was the same way. He'd have a drink maybe every morning, while I was fixing that coffee he hollered at me, he had a pint or half- pint, and he'd just have one little nip. Dad was about the same way. Dad would get on a bender maybe once a year. Grandpa, I never did see him drunk. And we finished that story. I'm gonna skip some time in there.

Anyway, I got on up into school, and when I was a junior, in February, all the kids, the only way we could get it is have somebody older than us get it before Dad set that up. So all of the kids give me the money, and I'd go get it. Grace B. Wilson, in fact, she said that Allen Foutz and I--he's a cousin of Jay and Loyd's that you interviewed out there. Him and I was really companionin'. She called us in and said-- had a cute little way of puttin' it--she said, "When you have a basket of apples and there's two rotten ones in there, if you leave 'em there, they'll just spoil the whole basket." So we knew what was comin'. She said, "I don't know very much about alcohol, and most people don't. Everybody just calls 'em the town drunks," back in those old days, you know. She said, "I think you two boys have got a problem with alcoholism. But that's not for me to determine. I'm just gonna expel you now, so that you can maybe do something about it. The only way you can get back in is your dad has gotta come in and sign for you and guarantee there'll be no more drinkin' on the school grounds." Neither one of us wanted to get into that, so I don't remember just how long [before someone] got word to Dad, but it snowed, and then it rained and sleet and melted the snow, and it was really muddy out there. It was three days before Dad got in. He asked me, "Do you want to go back to school?" And I said, "Well...." And he said, "Well, I'm gonna tell you how it is. Grace B. Wilson said that the only way, that I've got to guarantee her that you two boys won't be bringin' booze home. It's really my fault for settin' it up with Walter Stallings. I thought you guys would appreciate it and not overdo it." I said, "I don't believe ________." He said, "Fine. When did this happen?" I said, "Two or three days ago." And he said, "_____________," and it was snowin' outside again. He said, "Get your clothes packed. If you're too damned smart to go to school, you're too smart to be layin' around here." Here I am about the size of an eleven- or twelve-year-old at the most, at sixteen, but he wasn't worried about me, 'cause he had taught me all these things to do. He knew I was gonna make a livin'. I thought he'd lost his mind. He said, "I want you to leave right now." And then Mother went to cryin', "Please let him stay until tomorrow!" "No," he said, "they had three days. They knew they weren't goin' back to school." So he called Uncle Bert, told him what he had done. He said, "I just told Allen the same thing." Well, the basketball team from <Gallup> was over here. They didn't know that, but we knew that. We damned sure realized we had two mad fathers, and so we'd better get goin'. We went down to the high school and talked 'em into lettin' us ride in the trunk or whatever. Back then, they didn't bring 'em in buses, for some reason, but several of the parents brought 'em in cars. I got to set up in the back seat, they made room for me, and they put Allen (chuckles) in the trunk. It's a good thing they did, because when we got to <Shiprock>, Uncle Bert and Dad had found out that that's where we were goin'. Well, Dad wanted me to get out, because he figured I'd do what I done. But Uncle Bert was there, and everybody just said, "They didn't come with us." And there that kid was in the trunk. And he looked in and saw me, and he asked me, and I said, "I don't know what Allen done. He decided to stay."

So we went on to <Gallup>. We got in there, and Mom's younger brother was workin' for Gross Kelly Wholesale Company in <Gallup>, and I stayed with him that night, and then got on the truck and went out to <Greasewood>, Lower <Greasewood>, where Bill McGee and Ellis McGee was runnin' the store. Allen hitchhiked to <San Diego>. His older sister was married and livin' out there. So when we got out there, Lester Lee over at <Steamboat>, his wife had been real sick for several years, and just gradually gettin' worse. People had told him he ought to take her back to <Rochester Minnesota>, to Mayos' Clinic. So he said, "I've got to take her down ________" on the phone. Bill said, I know what you need. You need somebody to run <Steamboat> for you for a couple three months while you take Ann back there." He said, "That's right." He said, "I've got just the man for you," and here I'm a little old sixteen-year-old kid. But anyway, Bill loaded me up and took me over and Lester kept lookin' around, and finally he asked Bill, "Where's that guy you were going to bring over to me?" He said, "That's him settin' off there." "Oh! that damned kid can't run this store!" He said, "I'll guarantee you he can!" So anyway, he finally convinced him, and Lester loaded his wife up and left that night. So I run the store, and that was my first experience at really havin' the responsibility to run it, and I didn't know it at the time, but my granddad had gotten me ready to where I could do it, because back then, none of the Navajos hardly could talk English. The ones that could were workin' for BIA and wasn't around home. That was quite an accomplishment, really, to have the whole tradin' post turned over to you. 

Cole: What was that like, to run the store? 

Tanner: Seemed though it was natural. Had counters just like the old trading posts--like they got at Hubbell's there. They traded on lambs and wool. All I had to go by was what they'd got the year before. I had an old book to look it up. They'd make Navajo rugs, and I was able to buy them, just helpin' Mom in <Tsaya>, and then with Granddad out tradin' turquoise, he'd trade for rugs, too, you know. He trained me to where I could run that store __________. And so Lester come back, and he was really pleased with it. He said, "I can't believe you've done that!" I said, "Well, I need a job, but I know you don't need me now." So Bill got me a job then over at White Comb [phonetic spelling] for Francis Pyle [phonetic spelling], and I stayed there for about eight months, and got me a 1936 Ford coupe. I mean, you were somebody when you had one of them (chuckles) back then. I finally got that, and I drove over to <Kirtland>, and I stopped at Walt Stallings, got a good supply, like any alcoholic will do. I know now that's the reason I done it. I got there about thirty minutes before school was out, and all the girls just come runnin' over there to see that car, you know. And I'm settin' there drinkin' a beer in a leather jacket made out of calf hide, and brand new boots, you know. I was really somebody! (chuckles) Like a Navajo would say, "Dress up and be somebody!" That's how alcohol, even back then, gave me trouble. So I finally got the word after two or three days, I'd better get started to get out of there, because Miss Wilson was going to get ahold of Dad, and Dad wouldn't tolerate that kind of nonsense at all. So from there on, I went out to <Las Vegas Nevada>.

Probably some other stuff back when I was little. I think I covered pretty much in there, I think. I went out there and I found out I was afflicted with a compulsion to gamble as well as alcohol, because Stewart Hatch [phonetic spelling] has got.... There's another one you don't know. I ought to write his name down. He's down here at <Fruitland>. Stewart Hatch was a carpenter, and I was working as a carpenter's helper. So I would keep goin' over, doin' things that I wasn't supposed to be doin'. The boss would come around, and I was always ahead of him. But at any rate, he decided he'd better get rid of me before I mess up _______. They went ahead and paid me, and I went in town to <Las Vegas>. We were all stayin' at this little motel, and about an hour-and-a-half after I cashed my check, I found myself broke, playing slot machines and black jack. One place let me play until they decided I was too young. But anyway, I went over to the union hall, and this guy hollered out, "I need six good men." So, boy, (slaps hands together) I was really fast. I was the first one up there. There were five big colored guys. He said, "That'll make a good crew." So we went over there, and I'd make two trips--they had these five semis with this ninety-pound roofing paper, they call it. It's got gravel on it, kind of sand on it. Ninety- pound, they called it. So when we got through, he's payin' these colored guys, and he said, "I want to hire you. I want to put you on a roofing gang." I said, "Boy, that's great! My friends have all got a job, but I don't have one." I didn't tell him about being fired that morning. He said, "I'll just pay you on a regular check." I said, "What time do you have to go to work?" And I knew, as hot it was down there, that they'd go early. So he said, "Well, you gotta be to work at five o'clock in the morning. And then you get off early. You just work the eight hours ________." "I'll have to buy an alarm clock. Go ahead and pay me." And Stewart Hatch is the only one that I told that I'd lost all my money. That's how I got money to get that alarm clock. And then I got a job then....

I didn't like that much. I worked two or three months there, and then I got on as a pipefitter's helper. I learned the plumbing trade. This guy was scared of height, and they stored this pete moss, they called it. These buildings had to be 120 foot high, and the roof come way down and go up to real steep, about like this, but it was 120 foot in there. We had to take this pipe up with a block and tackle. So the guy didn't like bein' up there, so he said, "Why don't I do what you're doin', and pull that up there? You're not quite strong enough to pull that rope." So [I] went up and hooked them pipes up. But the reason I'm bringin' that out, alcoholics, if they manage to finally get sober, they're pretty damned good people, and they're sharp. God give us a little more brain than the average, so if we did happen to live through all of that, and got off of it, we still had enough sense left, enough brains left, to go ahead and make a living. So it was actually a privilege to be an alcoholic, if you could ever get straightened out. As I go along here, Brad, I'll be able to explain to you that I understand how come I had to go through all of that.

Then we all got drafted. I became eighteen, and we come home. At that time we had to go to <Santa Fe> on the bus, and then they took a physical in <Santa Fe>. There was a Marine colonel there that wanted me to go in the Marines to be in the Navajo code talkers, 'cause I was cuttin' up with the Navajos there. He didn't give up, he just took me off separate two or three different times, but I was bound and determined to go on with what I had planned, to get in the Air Force. And the way I look at my life, it's a good thing I did, because the way I was drinkin'.... I ended up on B- 26s--that's a two-engine bomber. And at the port of embarkation to <France>, they used them. And Louisi- industry, Port Louisiana, they sent us all out as an engineer-gunner, and then you had your pilot, co-pilot, navigator, and bombardier. Three days before we were to ship out to <France>, they decided they had enough over there, they saw they had control of it and were going to be able to shut <Germany> down without any more strafing bombers. So they transferred us to B-29s, they ones they used to drop the atomic bomb. The only way I know how to explain that, Brad, is it's kinda like goin' from a Model "T" Ford to a Cadillac. I mean, there's just no comparison. It's all electrical instead of hydraulic. So we just had to start all over in school again.

Well, they sent us to <Amarillo Texas>, for an eight- week course in electrical stuff that was in the B-29. Right away we went through that, and we were there another eighteen months. They couldn't decide, for some reason, to send us to <Denver> to radar school, or back to <Fort Myers Florida>, to gunnery school, because on the B-29s you didn't set in the turrets. Your sights is here, and you had control of maybe two or three different guns by radar. So it was eighteen months, and I lived off of the base, and I stayed at a hotel in there. We sold cigarettes--everybody did-- cigarettes were scarce, and we'd get 'em on the base. And gamblin' I done pretty good. So I was winnin' at gamblin', and I was makin' a lot of money all the time. I was workin' for Philips Oil Company in <Amarillo>, too. Then we went to <Nebraska> for a little while up there, and all of us got drunk. They had a cyclone hit up there, and it was so terrific that the wheat had been cut, and like they used to shock it, put 'em in bundles way back then. The wind was so terrific, that wheat straw would be all the way through a tree. You just had to see it to believe it. Well, that second night, the church people were really preachin'. They had beer iced down, and fried chicken--you know, the farmers all cooked so good, you know. All of us guys were just natural __________, 'cause that's all we'd been doin' in <Amarillo> for eighteen months. And so we went up to <Columbus>, I think was the name of that town. Anyway, we had two bad car accidents, killed three more people, and girls got killed. I'm bringing this out, because it was things like that, like I was mentioning, I should have listened to Grace B. Wilson on alcoholism, but I didn't. You don't want to admit that you can't drink normal.

They sent us to <Alamogordo New Mexico>. That was the port of embarkation through the <Philippines> and Batan and all the islands out there _________ <Japan>. Tinian was where most of the B-29s were at. Well, while I was there is when they dropped the atomic bomb. To make a long story short on that, I went to <El Paso> and got discharged.

Now I come back to all of this, within about a three- month period, my age group, they're all out of the service. And we just mostly stayed drunk in <Farmington> here. Finally I went to work out at <Aneth Utah>. My dad owned half of it, and his younger brother owned half of it. I was there for seven years, I believe it was. My first two kids I should mention. When I was at <Alamogordo> I went AWOL for eight days. It showed on my discharge, eight days AWOL. Nobody can figure out how come it didn't say what I got it for. Well, my commander on the B-29, he was transferred to <London England>. He said, "J. B., you went home, you got married, and I'm gonna do you one favor, and I probably shouldn't do it. I'm gonna take your papers that shows about this bein' AWOL. I'm gonna drop 'em in the Atlantic Ocean so you can go on home. I'm just gonna ask you one favor. Don't drink so damned much!" 'Cause I'd come out there drunk so much when we were trainin' to fly. One time one of my jobs was to get out and check the gas cap, and I was too sick. When it come to it, he asked me about the gas cap, [I responded], "Yeah, all secure." And I hadn't even been out there. And we took off, and the gasoline was comin'.... One cap wasn't.... Ordinarily, it would have just blown up. He turned it around and come right back in. I got my butt out there and put that cap on and he covered for me. But all of those things happened like that.

It's kind of like you have to talk to an alcoholic. And in A.A. [Alcoholics Anonymous] that's what you do, you share your hopes, strengths, and experiences. If you say you got a drinkin' problem, I'll tell you what I've been through so you can identify with that. And then you get some confidence, and you'll start sayin', "Well, what'll I do?" It's a fantastic organization. A.A. is second to none. I mean, those guys would get up.... And still at seventy-three--I'll be seventy- four the twenty-fourth of this month--I still get up when I'm called, any time day or night. That's what you have to do, if you want God to help you stay sober, 'cause he will remove that. Bein' able to talk Navajo-- and that's the reason I was able to, as I go on, I'll bring that out, bein' able to help the Indians. Probably one of their biggest problems.

That's a good place to stop, if we could, for a little bit. I'm gettin' a little dry. 

Cole: Sure. (tape turned off and on) So you had mentioned that you had just gotten married. What was your wife's name? 

Tanner: Lorraine Dora Shamp [phonetic spelling]. I want to put in here now that God put her down here. She's the only woman, absolutely the only woman that was put on earth, that would have put up with me. I know this now, because I've seen so much ________ drinkin' ________. So [God?] really helped me when I was gettin' my education in alcoholism, and giving me her as a wife. She left once and moved the kids back to <Farmington>. I'm kinda gettin' the horse before the cart. Anyhow, I want to finish that. When we were on [Gouwnton?], after I drank up the Navajo Shopping Center that I'll come to, and was down to Yah-Tah-Hey, she finally had a lawyer make up like she's gonna get a divorce, and called two big moving vans and moved to <Farmington>. But after I got in the Turquoise Lodge, and got sobered up and I come back.... I'll finish that story, Brad, when we get to it. But I want to put it in there, how important this woman was to me. I just wouldn't have been alive if she hadn't took care of me a lot of different times.

But anyway, back to <Aneth>. I've covered bein' AWOL to marry her. And we were there seven years at <Aneth Utah>. Dad sold his half about six months after I went down there, back to [Ralph?] that he'd agreed to do, with all of us guys in the service, 'cause he believed that Ralph would sell me part of it, but that's the way it had to be done, to go back to him, and then we'd have to.... Ralph didn't sell me part of it, but he put me on a third commission: whatever the store made, I'd get a third of it, instead of just wages. So I got in there and the Navajo people at that time didn't have much work goin' on. But during the war the railroads never did any repair work, and about the time I went to <Aneth> is when they decided to start repairing these railroads all over the <United States>. It turned out that the Navajos were the best ones they could get. So they gave them preference. They hired a lot more besides the Navajos--Spanish people, white people, and what have you. I'd send these young guys out to the railroad, and they'd send money orders back, so I'd give the family credit. Ralph couldn't stand it. He just knew that I was gonna bake him, I guess. He did have sense enough to leave me alone, and he went back to <Cortez> and built a motel up there, and just let me have [at it?].

It was about the time that peyote come. The Utes was usin' peyote. It's a sacrament in their Native American Church. But it's kind of a dope. Most people know what peyote is. Right away I figured out that the ones that was usin' peyote was most of 'em, at <Aneth Utah>, was, because from Toyok [phonetic spelling] it's just a little ways, and the Utes would come down and sell 'em peyote and teach 'em how to run these--it's an all-night sing, and you can drink the tea or the dried-- it looks like cactus. As long as you don't drink [alcohol] with it, it was very good, and I still say it's good for the Navajos if they use it right. But a lot of 'em finally got to where they were drinkin' wine with it, and it kinda made 'em crazy.

Seven years I was at <Aneth>. Startin' with the first year, about three times the profit that he'd made in the years that he was there. I made more money that one year than he did the three prior years. That was part of what done it, was this extra work done. And then I figured out that they was on peyote. When they're off, after they eat supper, they eat a little of that peyote and they kind of have an illusion of their family. It's against the law to do it, but I'd get the peyote from the Utes that come down there and sell it, and I'd box it up with the other stuff and send it to 'em. In one day--I'll cover that with this statement--the wool crop of all the sheep in <Aneth Utah>, the check come for the wool at Toyok, and that day I picked up more money in money orders than the wool check was. And that's the reason I made the statement peyote was good for the Navajo if they used it right. And I guess alcohol is good medicine for various things, like Grandpa used to have a drink in the morning to kind of get him goin' and take care of his arthritis and this and that. But I feel like Grandpa Joe teaching me Navajo made it possible for me to just come out of the service and take a trading post like <Aneth> and three times it--one-third was as much as he made by himself, and he's afraid he'd just [have to keep?] me. (chuckles) He just took the money and started buyin' property in <Cortez>, and Uncle Ralph died here a couple of three years ago, and he owned probably a third of <Cortez>, back from me makin' all that money for him. 

Cole: Did you have a Navajo nickname? 

Tanner: Yeah, I'll get to it. It's comin' here. Then, they called me Shash yáázh binálí. My grandfather, they called him Shash yáázh. They called my dad Doo bi_ hal díní. That's "hard to get along with." My dad was kinda hard to get along with. I think it was on account of the sheepherders and all the way he could discipline 'em. If it had just been the tradin' post he was runnin', I don't think he'd have got that name. But at any rate, they called me Shash yáázh binálí, "Little Bear's grandson," is what it means. I had a chance to--<Aneth Utah>, in comparison, is kinda like-- the tradin' post there is kinda like I said, the B-26 and the B-29. It's like goin' from a Model "T" to a Cadillac. Goin' from <Aneth> to <Keams Canyon> was kinda like the same thing--it was a bigger operation. It had Utes and it was just about ten times the volume.

I want to insert one thing back in high school. That was when we come out of the service and we was all drunk. The Mormons celebrate on the twenty-fourth of July. That's when Brigham Young come into Salt Lake, and they celebrate that. They always had a big rodeo and stuff when we were kids. They don't do rodeos now, but at any rate, they have what they call Relief Society. That's the women. We always felt like the Relief Society women were just gossipin' about us boys that drank too much. I come out of the chute on this horse, and none of us had had any training at bronc riding, so one of Dad's older brothers, [Art Tanner's boys?], Stan, was runnin' the rodeo, but it was all guys about my age that was doin' the ridin'. He said, "Now, you guys haven't had any practice, so you can use both hands instead of one." So they cinched me down and I'm so drunk I can't hardly get on there, but the horse bucked and my feet went up in the air, but I had both hands, so the horse bucked right back under me, and I come down on him. I went ahead and rode him. Everybody in the crowd thought I done it on purpose (laughs) and the judges. So I got first prize. And back then, it was quite a deal, $100. So that night at the dance, I donated my $100. I went up to the band and had 'em announce I wanted the Relief Society president, the woman that was in charge, to come up. So I signed the check and donated it to her to buy refreshments to talk about us guys. (laughter) But that's how crazy an alcoholic is, too. I mean, that was all uncalled for. I was just bein' a smart aleck, like all that stuff was. But at the same time, it was part of what--I didn't have no business even winnin' it, because the horse done it, bucked back under me or somethin'. But when I come down, I still had the saddle of him, and then I knew I had to quit messin' around and really ride him, which I did.

But the point I wanted to bring out was how cunning, baffling, and powerful alcohol is to an alcoholic. It's an obsession of the mind, coupled with a [neurology or crave?]. I'm bringin' this out now, because it gave me so much trouble up to this time at <Aneth>, and I was gonna go to <Keams Canyon>. And I decided in my own mind when I went over there I was gonna cut out drinkin'. I'd had nothin' but trouble, like I said here, from the time I was in school, in the service, and just little things happenin' in the service, such as that gas cap--just hundreds of things. I ain't got no business bein' here. But the good Lord looks after his drunks, I think. That's the only reason I'm here. And He had to give me a good enough education to where I had a real good story to share with you or whoever had a problem--no matter what your problem was, I've been through some of it. All drunks are different, but Navajos are a lot different to work with than Anglos. Spanish is kinda like 'em.

Now we can go to <Keams Canyon>. My two uncles were running it: William E. McGee--that's my mother's brother--and Cliff McGee. He, by this time, when I was kicked out of school, he's the one that got me on the Gross Kelly truck, sent me out to <Greasewood>. But he went out and went to work for Bill, while we were in service. He didn't have to go [into service] for some reason. Uncle Bill turned <Steamboat> over to me when I was sixteen, so he had a lot of good help there. But him and Cliff just went on a big thirty-day vacation when they got me to come out there. And so this lady-- I'm gettin' to the name you were askin' me--"I sound sleepy." That means "the woman that sleeps a lot." But Asdzáán ayóo 'a_hoshí. But they called her so sleepy, that the Navajos could say that sleepy. Then there's asdzáán. That means "woman." So she's a great big woman. She's about six- ten and real hefty. She brought in this big rug, and it was sixteen by twenty-two. And I hadn't seen a rug over at <Aneth> and <Teec Nos Pos> down here, Klagetoh, and <Sweetwater>.... where I was acquainted with, and then out here at <Tsaya> when I was a kid at <White Rock> with Grandpa. They didn't make big rugs. And an eight by ten was the biggest--you didn't see many of them. So I thought, "Well, boy, I'm in trouble. I don't know what to give for this rug or anything." So I'm talkin' Navajo to her, and she's laughin'. 

[END SIDE 1, BEGIN SIDE 2] 

Cole: (gives tape ID) J. B., you were just tellin' us about the first time you tried to buy a sixteen by twenty foot rug at <Keams Canyon>. 

Tanner: Yeah. I'll never forget that, Brad. This lady was big and everything, too, and I didn't know if I didn't handle her right, I was afraid she might whip me! (laughter) Anyway, I knew that as long as I could talk Navajo, I'd get it done some way, so I just kept talkin' to her and talkin' to her, and approached her from different angles, asking her about the weave and the dye she used. I finally told her I'd never seen a rug this big, and I was just going to have to depend on her to tell me what she usually sold 'em for. I had her go over and show me different things. Finally, she just went over on one end there, and there was kind of a step-off, going up into the jewelry department, about twelve inches high. She sat down on that step. (quotes woman in Navajo) "____________," she said. "__________." What that means is, "Quit talkin' about this rug and come set down by me." And she said, (in Navajo) "______________. I've never seen a white man talk Navajo like you do, and I want to know where you come from." I didn't know whether she meant where I went to school or what, but it come to me all of a sudden, (in Navajo) "___________," I said, "_________." "Oh, yeah?!" That means "a ladies' man from <Aneth Utah>." (laughter) So she laughed and she was a big, heavy-set woman, and I thought she was gonna roll off of that step and onto the floor. And every Navajo that come in--I got the rug, she told 'em how much and we traded it out, and she had three big wagons, and she got 'em all loaded up with flour and food, so she got enough food to go make a [big dinner]. She camped there for three days, and she told every Navajo that come in there what my name was. (in Navajo) "____________________________________." She'd really put the whole thing in there. So a lot of the Navajos, and where that comes from, is <Aneth Utah>. And Navajos, they called it ‘Áábíích’íídii. That means "the devil his self." But that didn't have anything to do with me. I just told 'em what they actually call 'em--told her <Aneth>, and that's where I come from. And a lot of people said, "J. B., that's gonna hurt you, talkin' about the devil, and bein' named ‘Áábíích’íídii." I said, "No, because it's got a 'yah' with it." A ladies' man, from <Aneth Utah>. And how <Aneth> got that name, this trader that was out there years ago, when it first started, he was really slow motion, and no matter how big a hurry people was, he still just took his time. He had to wait on everybody, because everything's behind the counter. An old man and his team, Sah-ga-nit-so [phonetic spelling] was this guy's name, was having a sing for his wife, and he had more people come than he had anticipated, and so he run out of some food. So he come into the store, and he was in one big hurry, and he wanted to get waited on and go. Well, this old man, he's just slow motion. Finally old Sah-ga-nit-so said, (in Navajo) "______________." And all the Navajos laughed. He got so mad and said, "He's just like the devil his self." When he died and went on, that was the name of <Aneth Utah>. So I have to tell that part. What I meant was, I was from there. For quite a while the Navajos, and even now, on my radio show, I have to explain that, because a lot of 'em ask me the same thing, "How did you get that name?" It's really served a purpose. In A.A. when you give a talk, you say, "I'm J. B. and I'm an alcoholic." But you also have to say it in Navajo, "____________," they call me. _________, that means, "an alcoholic." And that loosens 'em up. There'll be 200-300 of 'em in a meeting, and they just all--it gets 'em thinkin'.

When I got in--I'll just touch into this, and then we'll go a little way. When I finally got in Turquoise Lodge in <Albuquerque>, got sobered up, and I'd already drank the Navajo Shopping Center up.... I shouldn't be putting this in, but I want to get it where I don't forget. Anyway, we had A.A. groups going in practically every chapter, and MacDonald got elected president, chairman of the council. And he hired social drinkers to be the head of the alcoholic department, so he got all that money for treatment centers and stuff. I'll tell you, that about broke my heart, to where those A.A. members just quit. They weren't going to listen to a bunch of guys drinkin', tellin' 'em how to stay sober. But I wanted to bring that out there, Brad, so that it's so important, that even the most premature gentleman, that you can think about, and there might be some questions you want to ask on it, but goin' from "So Sleepy" after I got that name, (in Navajo) ____________, we done the same thing. Clarence Wheeler, that you've taken his.... He was runnin' Polacca, and I was runnin' Keams, both of us percenters. And we done about the same thing that I done at <Aneth>--really increased the volume. And so my brothers, Bob and Don, to start with, and a guy by the name of Jack Leonard, had been workin' for the Navajo Tribe in its uranium mines in various different places. In fact, the Navajos found the uranium that was used for the bomb at <Alamogordo>, and then the ones that was dropped in <Japan>. But this Jack Leonard was a guy up high in that. So I thought I had quite a bit of money comin' to Keams. Back in those days, when you were on a commission, you had to stay the full year to get your commission, I found out. But I had a chance to buy Ganado Trading Company, and Noslini [phonetic spelling] Trading Company. And so then I contacted, like I said, Jack Leonard and Don and my brother Bob. And the four of us went over and bought Ganado and Noslini from Hugh Lee. His dad was Albert Lee, and Art Lee was his brother. I think he lived down in <Flagstaff> ________.

Albert went on a mission for the Church, and he gave Art power of attorney. And the payments that older brother Hugh was supposed to be making was another income that I would have--Art handled it. Well, right away we fired them two businesses up at <Ganado>, and it was definitely hurting all the surrounding stores. They thought it was hurtin' 'em worse than it was. Back in those days, the bankruptcy law wasn't like it is now. At that time, any three creditors could put the demand on you--in <Arizona>, anyway--and this is where <Ganado> was, in <Arizona>. Art Lee.... (aside about faulty memory) But there's four of 'em, four traders, but Art was the main one. They just decided they'd better get rid of me out there. So they had these three creditors in Holbrook, put the demand on, and they drew up the papers, and gave the sheriff the demand thing--I don't remember just what legally you call it. But on a Saturday evening, the sheriff drove in out there, and I mean, we had these stores.... I was the only trader that was ever had the demand put on 'em before sheep season. Navajos had all this credit on lambs and cattle, and in the spring, the wool. And that's what kept 'em goin', was that credit. The first of November I could have paid everybody I owed, and had quite a bit left, but the first of September, I couldn't. I might have been able to go get some to pacify those three, but I didn't think it was fair to all the other creditors in <New Mexico>, like Gallup Mercantile in <Gallup> and everything. So I made a stand, not knowing what they could do. Clyde Teec [phonetic spelling] was one of 'em, and Don Wheeler, and Lester Lee. Lester did not run his store _________. So that's the four of 'em.

So Monday morning they're out there with an auctioneer, and they auctioned off the grocery sacks and the hardware section and the feed department and the dry goods and the shoe department. They divided it up to where it was about an equal fourth. I found out later that there were four of 'em that had instigated it. They guaranteed these creditors that I had in Holbrook--the Coca-Cola Company and the drug company, and I think it was produce--that they would get their money. But they auctioned this stuff all off at about ten, fifteen cents on the dollar--just enough to pay these three creditors. And Art, he got all of the pawn, accounts receivable. Here it is, the first of September, and a big stack of checks had come in that Monday; and the pawn was $50,000-$60,000. Here I sat there.

Before the sheriff left--I want to insert this-- Saturday, the vault had $15,000 in cash that Tobe Turpen [phonetic spelling] in <Gallup> was one of the finest and one of the greatest traders. He's dead now, but he had let me have this $15,000 to start my lambs with, because some of 'em would come in, and they'd have $50 comin', or $200, $300, $400, or $500. You had to have money to give 'em over and above what they owed. So he advanced me that, and then he was going to handle the sheep. I talked the sheriff into letting me take that money and give it back to him, because it didn't have nothing to do with.... And I showed him the date and the contract for lambs. So I did get to protect him, and the sheriff said, "I'm not supposed to do anything like this, but I know Tobe Turpen, too." So he let me take the....

Now we're back to Monday. They were just backin' up trucks and loadin' the damned stuff all up. I thought you'd have time to go make arrangements. I hadn't even talked to a lawyer over the weekend, 'cause I didn't know ______________. So Bill McGee was kinda mad at me for leavin' <Keams Canyon> and goin' on my own. But he said, "I can't blame you, because I know Hugh's not gonna keep the stores, and I'd like to see you have 'em." But he was still mad at me, because he had brought me from <Aneth> over there. So he got me Conrad Kleinman [phonetic spelling], his attorney in <Phoenix>, to handle it for me. And so they put me in what you call involuntary bankruptcy. Now it's handled altogether different. You get to keep certain things. They even took a .22 rifle, single-shot rifle. What I'd done, I had to move someplace, so I moved into <Gallup> [with Demerkle?]. And that's when I got acquainted with Pete Videll [phonetic spelling] that owned--coal mining town there, and that's what Demerkle was, mined coal. And the railroad spur out there. The big mine was there, and they built these coal cars and take it down. So when trains come through <Gallup>, they'd load those _________.

I got acquainted a little bit with Pete there. But I couldn't do anything for eight months to a year, Conrad Kleinman told me. So I made a deal with Bill McGee, and he'd just bought <Piñon> Trading Company. And Paul Jones, in my opinion, was next to Chee Dodge or even about as good, chairman of the council at that time. Paul Jones and Uncle Bill were real good friends, is how come the tribe had owned <Piñon> themselves. They tried to run three or four--I think it was five or six stores, and they just couldn't, havin' trouble. And <Piñon> was the last store that they had, and Bill bought it from 'em. Accounts receivable was to be paid for as it was collected, and if you couldn't collect 'em, the tribe just throwed 'em in. So Bill made me a deal, that I come out there, after he got Conrad Kleinman to handle the paperwork and stuff in <Phoenix>. Being as it's in <Arizona>, you had to go all the way to <Phoenix>. All my <New Mexico> creditors, they had to turn in their bills. But it didn't end up that any of 'em got hardly anything, because these guys hadn't give nothing for the merchandise. 

Underhill: And what year was this? 

Tanner: I think it was 1957. No, John was born in fifty-_______. The latter part of the fifties. So I went to <Piñon> for this period, and it turned out to be between eight and nine months. There again, I had a big break. It's when all these guys had been workin' on the railroad that I mentioned at <Aneth>--they'd been workin' over here, too. They started up what they called the Railroad Retirement for these people. And in the winter months, they would draw a check when they was off work, and it was a big thing for 'em. They had a winter income, and they'd go back in the summer and work. A lot of 'em was startin', bein' as they was workin', was getting a lot of Social Security. A lot of 'em at <Piñon> didn't have the census numbers. Navajos was multiplyin' so fast, the way they had things goin', they wasn't keepin' up with 'em on that. So a lot of 'em didn't have a census number. So I figured out right away that <Piñon> could really be something, if I could get all of this stuff goin'.

Bill Stryker [phonetic spelling] was the head of the Trading Division and was over all the trading posts. I went and saw him and Paul Jones and told 'em that these accounts that went with the deal, but it wasn't payable until they was collected. And I said, "I need to get rid of 'em." And they agreed that if I'd bring $2,500-- and I suggested that I could get Bill to give me a check for $2,500--it was an enormous amount _______-- and I'd already collected quite a bit of 'em, because these people was tickled to pay whatever they owed when they started to gettin' these checks. And I got 'em all lined up. And to show you how it amounted to, they had owned <Piñon> three months. The average actual cash sales was $10,000 a month. And that was big cash sales back in those days. _______ $2,000 or $3,000 was big, until this railroad stuff started up. These people just couldn't believe that I was gettin' these checks for 'em. And so Paul Jones and the chairman and Bill Stryker agreed to just go ahead and take $2,500. I said we should have done that to start with--and then if you collect 'em, fine, if you don't, then we shouldn't even be involved in it out there. So I went and called Bill in <Phoenix>, and he come out, and Cliff at Keams. And we took care of that. When I was in Demerkle, they come and took that .22 rifle in the house I rented there at Demerkle before I went to <Piñon>, I got acquainted with Pete Videll that owned--he had bought this town of Demerkle from the mining company. And in fact, he just fell into it. But he had leased a portion of it where the Navajo Shopping Center is, to Cy Grave [phonetic spelling] from <Cortez Colorado>. The trader up at Toyok--I can't think of his name right now, I'll think of it in a minute--and his four or five other businessmen, <Cortez> and <Farmington>, that was in this organization, to run a livestock auction in that big quonset building that's there. I don't know whether you've ever been over there or not. It was there. Big set of corrals out there, just perfect for J. B.

Back when I told you that the Relief Society lady.... I said, "By the way, you guys will have somethin' to talk about. There isn't a trading post big enough for me. I'll have to build the damned thing." That's how smart aleck, you know. So this was it in my mind. So these guys had [a bird nest?] on the ground, but they didn't know how to handle the Navajo. They didn't realize that when a Navajo loads something-- whether it's <Piñon>s, a cow, a goat, a horse, a rug, or what--he wants the money for it. The reason he loaded it to you, he needed the money. They wouldn't advance 'em. They got 'em waitin' 'til Thursday or Wednesday, whenever the sale was, and they messed around and they went broke, they just couldn't make it work. But I seen right away how you could work it. I had to make a decision. Well, I'm gettin' just a little bit ahead.

But I had to make a decision, after Pete leased it to me for $300 a month, that whole big layout, for five years, with an option for five more. So I had to make a decision whether to bring some auction people in that I didn't know how it worked either, but I did know we'd have to work the Navajo. If he unloaded a steer that was worth $100, you know it was gonna bring $100, you'd advance him $75. That's more than he could get anyplace else. If you advance him more than he could get, he's gonna be happy. And then when it went through the auction, we'd send him a check for it. This was the time they were startin' to get pickups, more so than.... A lot of 'em that couldn't work for the railroad, didn't have the cash income. So I just decided to do it myself, and I got a guy by the name of Jerry Crow [phonetic spelling] in <Denver>, that's a big sheep buyer, to come down and keep the market open for whatever--whether it was goats or jackasses or crow bait horses or cattle or whatever it was. He would keep the market open. And I mean, when that thing took off, it was unbelievable.

But I went back out to <Piñon>, and I told Bill, "I've got to leave early again, like I did when I went to <Ganado>." This was the first of August in 1957, when we started that. I figured I had.... I'll have to insert Keams. At that time I had $14,000-$16,000 comin', but Bill ________ decided I had to stay 'til November to get it. And so I said, "I gotta go anyway." So I had to do the same thing with <Piñon>. I figured that I had, with these accounts and everything, just in eight months, my last three months, the cash sales was over $40,000 a month. I had had four timesed it from the $10,000 they had done the first three months. Besides, I had a lot of others they could go ahead and get on. I said, "You guys figure out what I've got comin', and I'm gonna go, whatever it is. I've gotta get in there and get this thing established through sheep season-- get the Navajos to know what I'm doin'." I didn't tell them what I was gonna work __________. He thought I was completely nuts again. He called Mom and told her, "This is the last time I'm gonna try to help Buddy." My nickname was Buddy.

I should mention this. When I was born, Dad wanted to name me after my grandpa, Joseph Baldwin, and Dad said, "Hell, he's too little to put that on him." But Joseph Baldwin's front initials is J. B., so that's how I got my name, J. B., because I wasn't big enough for Joseph Baldwin. But at any rate, when I was in the service, I had a hell of a time there, gettin' by. They wanted me to be John or Jim, keep the "B." But no, I wouldn't do it. They finally put "I.O." on my dog tags, "initials only."

At any rate, I told Bill, I said, "Well, give us...." And Clarence owned part of it, Clarence Wheeler, and Cliff and Bill. Bill owned half, I think. Cliff and Clarence a fourth a piece. So they figured it up, and they sent the night man that was in there cleanin', over to my house to tell me they had it figured out. So I went in, and they handed me a check. It was $189.50 or thereabouts. I said, "You guys givin' me the wrong check here or what?" And they said, "No. You're leavin' before inventory, and somethin' might happen. All this profit won't show up. You know, ________ a bomb could hit it and blow it all up, and this and that." Bill said, "No, that's how it is. Take it or leave it." So I turned it over and signed it and I throwed it back over on the desk and I said, "You guys need this worse than I do." But I mean, I really needed.... Back then, it was equivalent to when I come, between $20,000 and $30,000. It's equivalent to $200,000 or $300,000 now, with what you could do with it.

But anyway, I had twenty dollars in my pocket. I loaded Lorraine and the kids up. Sherry, the one that come picked John up, she was born while we was there at <Ganado>, so she was just a baby, and John wasn't born then. We got in and we got a room at the motel, had breakfast the next morning. I'll tell it this way, I had a dollar three eighty-five left. Just an old saying I have. But actually, it was $1.85. That paid the motel and breakfast and supper that night. The next morning I got up. I had paid Pete Videll the first and last month on the lease, $600, and I drawed it out of Keam. So I don't know whether you know where Gross Kelly's used to be, the wholesale house. It was there on the one-way street goin' out old triple six [Highway 666], and then on over the other one, <Gallup> Mercantile was on the other one. Comin' in, it's a one- way street from [back?], and it turned across those bridges. Well, I met my brother Jerry, and he had a store at <Kayenta>. He was killed later in a plane crash. D. B. Clark [phonetic spelling] had had the flyin' service in <Gallup>. But he said, "C'mon, let's go have some coffee." It was right on the tracks. And I said, "Go on down to Fairmont, and I'll turn around and come on down." And he went down, and I told him what I was up against. I said, "Whatever you can come up with will help." He said, "Well, I can write you a check for $2,500. I know it ain't much, but," as he put it, "it'll give you walkin'-around money while you're puttin' the bigger money together." I said, "But you don't know how I appreciate that, 'cause I just got $1.85 left." So I got Frontier Airlines in there in <Gallup>, and there's a plane over--I think it left at 10:30--and one from <Denver> would pick you up in <Farmington>, take you back to <Gallup>, around 2:00 or 3:00, whatever it was. Well, this check he give me was on Farmington Bank, and I wasn't established with anybody in there, and just goin' through that involuntary bankruptcy, I couldn't afford to take a chance on them cashin' it. So I flew over there and came over here and cashed it and then went back.

That night I went out and seen a guy by the name of Bernie Vanderwagen. I knew he was one of the biggest sheep buyers at that time--him and Tobe Turpen. But Tobe was sick, the one I'd salvaged that $15,000 for, or I'd have went to him. But he was sick and down in <Tucson>--pneumonia or something _____ Tonopah. I went out and seen Bernie, and I told him, "We can start buyin' ewes and lambs"--this was the first of August-- "or ___________ want to do, Bernie, just buy any damned thing they bring in, no matter what it is, at a price that we can both make some money on. You let me make some money, and I'll let you make some money." So he said, "Well, we can talk about this later," but he wrote a check out for $5,000, and he said, "This'll get you started." He didn't have any idea whether it'd be.... I told him, "You'd better damned sure come to town in the morning by noon, because this won't last very long." But he give me the five, and I had that $2,500. I let Don take $2,000 of it, I think, if I remember right, and go down to Buvany [phonetic spelling] Lumber Company, buy lumber to start making shelving and make a supermarket-type in this quonset building. And then we built steps up to the scales, over in the livestock building in the back, and put a vault on each side--one for the bookkeepers on one side, and pawn on the other--and then put these homemade shelving deals. Don done a hell of a good job on that. He really done a good job. He checked California supermarkets and....

I think it was about September 10, Bernie had everything covered. He had a lot of grazing land out towards <Zuni>, <Whitewater> and in there. And he leased a lot of _______. Finally, he got some lamb buyers and we started to rotatin'. He'd sell some. We managed to get some cash flow comin' back just before they buried it. And this D. B. Clark that I mentioned--Jerry--they went into the side of the mountain out there and killed both of 'em. But D. B. Clark loaned me quite a bit of money later in September. And Fred Capigia [phonetic spelling] that owned the Pepsi-Cola plant was a financier. I had four of 'em, ________. And Uncle Don, Colin's [phonetic spelling] dad, he--I called him, and he come over--I told him, "I need to stock these shelves that Don's gonna build here." He always had a habit of rubbin' his forehead. You just had to let him go through his procedure--_______ guy. He always liked to lay down on the couch when you were tellin' him a deal. So I knew that, so I had a couch on the left. I said, "Come on over here, Uncle Don. I've showed you everything. Here, lay down on this couch." He said, "Well, it's gonna take quite a bit to stock this. This is a big store." I said, "Well, it'll take $30,000, at least." That was a lot of merchandise back then. And he said, "I haven't got that much loose money. And it's wheat time, I'm buyin' all this wheat from the farmers, and I'm committed on it." I said, "Well, Henry Polacca believes in me. But due to that bankruptcy, he can't jump in, 'cause ________ of his money on <Ganado>." Kind of had me between a rock and a hard place. I said, "The reason I got you over here is to guarantee him. You don't have to come up with any money, you can just guarantee me." He said, "Well, I'll just go tell Henry to give you the __________ in thirty. It'd be $40,000. As I bring the flour to him, he don't pay me, he just credits. I'll pay him off with flour," because he furnished all the trading posts, see. Well, that stocked it. Within six weeks.... (laughs) This is the fifteenth of September. Within six weeks, with $1.85, Don and I had that thing stocked and ready to go.

I don't know whether you guys have heard of Ed Lee. I'll tell you, he was a radio announcer and well-known Navajo. Beautiful voice. He was just really a good announcer, and he could sing those beautiful Navajo songs like nobody else. I went to see him when I first got in town, but when we got the store stocked, we built a place up there where me and Robert E. Lee--and Ed and I'll tell you would be where the Indians could see us, __________, on KGAK, the Navajo station there in <Gallup>. And I told him, "It's just like TV. When you're home, now that you see us talkin' to you here, when you come in, you see us, you just shut your eyes, and you can see us just like you see TV looks." And they got a big bang out of that. And that's the way that peyote was, too. They'd shut their eyes and eat a little bit of peyote, and they could see their family. I think they really could. Just illusions, I guess. Man, they took good care of their family. There's lots of Navajo families out there that if it hadn't been for peyote comin' in, would have drank theirselves to death, because we didn't have Alcoholics Anonymous goin' much then, or no way for 'em to....

Between Ed Lee Notay [phonetic spelling], it was the darnedest thing you ever seen. Even the MJB Coffee Company--that's my initials, "M" and J. B.--I told all the Navajos, "This is Mister J. B. Coffee." (laughter) I called <Denver> and told 'em to send their salesman, one with authority, on credit. I told him, "I can't explain this to you over the phone, what this operation is, but you send one of your top men down here, and you got one of the best accounts you'll ever have for MJB. There's a whole Navajo Tribe out here that's gonna start drinkin' it. They liked Schilling's and Hill Brothers, I think. We changed that. And they sent a carload down and gave me thirty, sixty, ninety days to pay for it. I had three railroad carloads in three months. We paid for a third of it, and as I paid for one, they'd send another one. I had it up there, and the volume was so great that we accumulated money there to buy a [cabin?] with, and stuff that we didn't have to pay. The Navajo people are just fabulous, the way they supported it.

Charlie Williams had the Chevrolet agency, selling Chevrolet trucks and stuff. I told him right in the same period there, the first of October I want you to have a big line of trucks and stuff out here, and these Navajos all have money for down payments, and they can pay. Oh, man, those livestock people, they didn't have no credit, you know, or rated anything. ________ "If you don't do it, Sara Gurley [phonetic spelling] will, or Rayco [phonetic spelling] that had GMC." But I liked Charlie the best, and so I gave him first chance at it. Those Navajos just come and really give me a big hug. "Thank you, J. B.! We couldn't have got a new truck like this if you didn't tell him that we're good payers." And then all I had to do is load something up and sell a rug, or like a <Piñon> crop, or hides, or whatever. They could pawn for cash. Up until then, most pawn was just border trade. The ones that didn't have very good credit, they had to pawn for it. The good credit ones that had livestock, sheep and cattle, the traders....

Gettin' back to those four traders out at <Ganado>, they wished to God that they'd left me at <Ganado>, 'cause the Navajo Shopping Center was just.... I don't know how many times <Ganado> ever thought of bein'. But the Navajo people was ready for a change, and actually as time went on, there were enough people who got on some type of welfare, Social Security, [Aid to] Dependent Children, that the traders out there that was mad at me, their business, they started to give 'em credit on these checks that was comin' to the old people and dependent children, women without husbands. So actually, it didn't hurt 'em like they thought it was goin' to--just due to that Railroad Retirement money that we all worked on, and we got the census numbers. This is a process from <Aneth> to Navajo Shopping Center of about twelve years that it took to get this line of thinkin' to where the Indian was ready, and the people--even after goin' through involuntary bankruptcy--to be able to get credit. The only damned reason they went with me was because the Indian was with me. And if MJB didn't go with me, or the only reason Uncle Don even went, he felt secure, was because he knew someway, somehow, credit is not always how you pay, it's if the wholesale people are gonna lose business. Just like with MJB, I used.... Once I got MJB to go, I knew I could get Schilling's and ________. I think I kept just MJB for a month, Christmastime. Then finally I told the Navajos, "If you'd rather have ________ the red cans, Schilling, or Hill Brothers, we can put it in." But that credit, nobody but an alcoholic could figure all this stuff out. Like I told you, God give alcoholics more brains than an average person, so that if you did listen and realize that your only way to live was with His help-- every morning you have to ask Him to help you not drink today--it's just that simple. If you don't take the first drink, you don't get drunk. And that's the way A.A. works. And the A.A. fellowship, what they've been through, they share their whole strengths and experiences. And at night, you load 'em up and take 'em to <Albuquerque> and get 'em in Turquoise Lodge and come back and even though you were up all night, come back and work the next day. That's just the way it is.

But so many people don't realize--they all say, "You no good drunks!" you know. I'll admit, I was the sorriest SOB that ever was. But I can truthfully say that as [the gentleman?] Navajo Shopping Center ______, the ones that wasn't ______ at <Ganado>, I eventually got 'em all paid. And they all kind of unwillingly helped me after about two or three months--some of 'em took six months before they come in. 'Cause I couldn't start payin' any of 'em anything for about a year there, 'cause it was growing too fast. But the psychology of "I'm gonna miss out," is what gets people to back you. And no matter what you've done.... That's the reason I think so much of the Navajo people: They supported me to where I could do that.

Okay, now we'll get to about that support. I had a corporation. I had to borrow more money, like Piñons take several million dollars to buy <Piñon>, ___________. So the only way I could do it was get some stockholders in there to put money in for stock, and I got three: a guy by the name of Peter Crails, John I-rik, and D. J. Elkins [all phonetic spellings]. One of those was an insurance guy, John I-rik. And D. J. was really good with cattlemen--he's a ranger, so he could be a lot of help in the operation, for handling all the cattle business and horses and sheep. So there was three of 'em, and there's five in our family. There was Mom and Bob and Don and Joe and Jerry. There was five of us that had stock in 'em.

Well, I discussed when John-John was born, I didn't drink hardly anything in about a year-and-a-half to two years, gettin' this thing goin'. I was just so enthusiastic in doing it that I didn't have time to drink, and gettin' everybody coordinated. And then John-John was born. I was at the point that I imagine even if he hadn't been born a mongol [Down's syndrome] child, I'd have found some other excuse. But that was the excuse that I used. I had Kay's older son and Kathy and Sherry that you met, and finally got this going. In fact, when he was born on Christmas Day, mind you--that shows you how special he is--I think it was seven or eight days I was just gone partyin', celebratin'. You know, finally got that boy! The next thing I knew, the business was fantastic, and I got it in my head that if I went in some type of business in <Las Vegas>, that my help wouldn't all get upset because I was goin' out there so much. So I bought this single- engine Bonanza, and I hired this guy to fly it for me, and I went in with Reid Foutz, which is a cousin of Loyd and Jay, and a brother to Allen that got kicked out of school with me. But Reid ended up on the First and Last Chance on Highway 91 comin' into <Las Vegas>, right on the state line. He got this property. It was a bar and what have you out there. I went in with him and we went to work on gettin' the licenses and stuff and got slot machines in first. There's a dry lake bed there where we could land. It was kind of comical. This pilot, he got to where he knew just whether or not I'd get in the plane and then I'd relax and drink. At that time I could drink a lot and still navigate. But I wasn't takin' care of business like I should.

But anyway, there was a big power line runnin' across this dry lakebed, so we'd always land on either side of it, goin' with it, so he didn't have to go under it. Well, it was late in the evening, and I don't know, for some reason, he was mad at me. We were coming in, and I had this drink. I put it over in this hand, and I had it up here on his seat. I put my hand up on the dashboard. It's a good thing I did, because about that time, when we were supposed to be landing, he had forgot to put the landing gear down, so we come in and made the most beautiful belly landing that's ever been made in a single-engine plane. Didn't even spill any of my drink! Just come in smooth and the prop was all bent up. I just finished my drink. I said, "Well, thanks for not spillin' my drink." I got out, and here come Reid and them down there, in a pickup to get us. We went back up and called an airport to come and get it. Just crazy things like that, that happened, that shouldn't have.

Another time there, old Bob, brother next to me, he was a student pilot. He borrowed Phil Foutz's single- engine Cessna to bring me down one time. We stayed for two or three days down there, and I called up to the store--something I had to get back that night, and it was just already dark. Bob said, "I'm not supposed to fly on a student's license at night. Let alone I'm not supposed to fly with a passenger. Let's wait to go until daylight in the morning." I said, "Hell, you can handle it."

We get in and we start back. We found out it was <Cedar City>. We kind of got off, was a little too far over. But up on top before, there was an airstrip all lit up down there. So I said, "Well, before we go any farther, let's land there and see if there's somebody there. We'll find out where in the hell we're at." So he landed, got down. I said, "Well, there's nobody here." This is El Paso Natural Gas, and they was runnin' these gas lines all over the country up here. They put strips in every so often, so they could fly the big shots in. That's what it ended up bein'. So Bob just begged me. He said, "We're safe here." I said, "Let's get back up and we'll get over there to that highway, and we'll follow these car lights until we come to something." I don't know whether you guys have been down that road from <Las Vegas> to <Cedar City> or not, but [them cliffs?] are really high, that nose right out on the bottom. I don't think that we were ever all the time above the thing. I think there were probably times that _____________. But all of a sudden, <Cedar City> lights come on. We didn't know it was <Cedar City>. We're comin' in to land--the reason I'm tellin' it--comin' in to land, and all of a sudden, the lights on the strip were not there. So we knew there was a hill between. And Bob was tryin' so hard to do it right, that he grabbed the throttle and pushed it too quick or too fast and it conked out. But he did pull the nose back, and we settled--God had a nice plowed field there, that that landing gear hit in that soft plowed dirt, and it flipped over on its back. We both had our seatbelts on. Thank God He was lookin' after us. I had my hand up on the dashboard, and my nose come down and hit it, and my nose was bleedin'. I asked Bob, "Are you okay?" He said, "Yeah, I think my ankle's hurt." We're hangin' upside down, you know. I don't know if you remember Steve Canyon, used to be in the funnies. He had that happen to him, his plane flipped over, and he was hangin' down there. I said, "Hell, if Steve Canyon can get out of here, let's get unhooked here." So we got unhooked, and fell down on our heads. We got out there and I remembered I left my bottle in the plane. So I ran back over and got my bottle. As I was running back over where he was, I had to help him, because his ankle was bruised bad. Here the car lights come shinin' down there. I had my bottle, and I took a drink. That was the worst thing you could do. Within two hours, we had a plane chartered and back in the air, twin engine. But the plane, too, right when I took that drink, the gas drippin' on that engine, some way it ignited, and the whole plane burned down. So that's another crazy damned thing.

[END SIDE 2, BEGIN SIDE 3] 

Cole: (gives tape ID) You were just going to explain to us some of the differences between trading on the reservation versus trading at the Navajo Shopping Center. 

Tanner: Well, that's really a good question. I'm glad you brought that up. That was one of the reasons, in order to help the Navajos get a cash flow, that I went to <Gallup> at this place in Demerkle to start with, 'cause on the reservation you couldn't--their laws out there wouldn't let you loan 'em money when they didn't want to sell somethin', to make a car payment and so forth. And there were just all kinds of regulations and one thing or another that made it hard for the traders to help the Indians. But after I opened Navajo Shopping Center up, they all pretty well had to start doin' the same thing. But I mentioned there that all those welfare checks and everything, that become the trading post business. Checks that come out there, and the livestock and stuff--those people, they sold it where they could get the [most?], that I had originated.

I had a problem with the stockholders of the Navajo Shopping Center about this time. They gave me a choice. There were five in the family on there, and Don sided with the other three and gave me the ultimatum of either buyin' or sellin', so I sold out to them. And they got most of their money from Adrian Barryhill [phonetic spelling], which just out of Grants, he had a big uranium mine on his ranch and had made a lot of money.

Well, after I left Navajo Shopping Center, I went out to Vegas 'cause I had this deal with Reid. I went through most of the money I had in that, and when I come back to <Gallup>--I don't recall just how long it was, a month or two--I had $4,000 left, which is pathetic. But a guy by the name of Harv Wilson owned the property where Yah-Tah-Hey is. And he sold me that 120 acres, everything, all the land east of the highway, in 1967. It was approximately 130 acres. Well, I bought it, and he said, "I'm gonna sell it to you, kid." He could talk real good Navajo, too.

Harv and I had quite a thing goin' when I first got out of the service. He was chief of police on the Navajo Reservation, and I coming from <Aneth> up to <Shiprock>, too, that yé’ii bicheii, and fair they have every October. The dancing yé’ii bicheii came from <Aneth>. I was cuttin' up with 'em there. And old Harv, he didn't like me, for some reason. The only thing I could ever figure out is <Crownpoint>, well, I was with my Grandpa Joe and they were having court, and he was the interpreter. And he told the judge that this guy said this and that. I jumped up and said, "No, he didn't say that, he said this." Everybody that could talk Navajo knew that I was right. So he was kind of aggravated with me over that. So two big Indian policemen, one on each side, took me in, and they throwed me in the drunk tank at <Shiprock>. And I mean, those Navajos at that time, it was illegal to drink. When they got a bottle on, they drank it all. So there I was in there, I had puke all over me. Even this Stewart Hatch that I told you--that's his brother-in- law--tried to get him to let me out, and he wouldn't. But there's all these years in between, while I was doin' all this other stuff. He said, "I'm gonna sell this to you, J. B." They'd call me Buddy then. "I know you'll do with it what I would have liked to have done. You'll make a nice business out of it." So he sold it to me for $60,000--no payment except interest the first year. The interest was 6 percent, and twenty years to pay. And it come $415.28 was the payment. And he said no prepayment, "I want that for my retirement." Well, again, back there, there's a pretty good little check comin' in for retirement then.

So I agreed to it, but after I got goin' out there, well, the Navajos got a big bang out of it. I didn't have those big scales and corrals and stuff. We had to buy the lambs, you'd take ahold of 'em and turn 'em on their back in a number three washtub and you could weigh him on his back in that tub, and you'd just tip the tub over and let him out. These Navajos was backed up there and [gettin'] a big bang out of it, just like a rodeo, you know. And so I was open while they were fixin' the store. There's a building made out of ammunition boxes, and the more the stucco was on it, and it was a hundred by forty--a hundred foot long and forty foot wide.... So I hired a couple of guys, a cousin of mine, Lynne Tanner and Henry Andrews, to come in and pour the cement floor and start doin' what Don done at the shopping center, while I started to buyin' the sheep and stuff again. And the Navajos, big long lines. But they were patient, and I'd help them, so they were helping me. Not all of 'em, but enough of 'em to put me back in business.

So as we were just ready to open the store, and this Adrian Barryhill come out. He says, "Buddy, I don't think D. J. and Don gave you a fair deal. I loaned 'em most of the money to do it and pay off a lot of stuff, besides you. I want to make it right with you." I said, "All right, I could use a little extra money." He said, "I want to give you $50,000 more." And I said, "Wait a minute. There's gotta be some kinda catch to it. Even with all the money you got, you're not gonna give me $50,000 for nothin', I know that." He said, "Yeah, the one only thing is, you gotta go to either <Flagstaff> or <Farmington> or Holbrook--we'll even put it in, it's ninety miles--but within a hundred-mile radius of <Gallup>, you can't go in business." So I said, "Well, Adrienne, I wasn't on any type of welfare-- federal, state, county--when I come to <Gallup>, and I'll have to consider your deal as a welfare offer. Anyway, if I'm not a free agent, I can't go where I want to." So I said, "I want to be friends with you, but I don't need $50,000 that bad." So he went on and I'll have to insert this.

Adrian had two daughters, and this is Sherry's age. He had them nice pickups and trailers and barrel racin' horses, and I had the same with Sherry--she was really good at it. So they'd come and big pals. You know, they'd go all over barrel racin'. But one of the girls was killed one year, and two or three days after the year was up, the other one was killed. So they kinda adopted Sherry, best friends. And when Mrs. Barryhill died, she included Sherry in her will. I wanted to mention that, because after him tryin' to be what was right, and she knew about it, and I think that's one reason he ended up dealing with Sherry. And I wanted to bring that in. Everybody's got some good in 'em, no matter what.

As time went on out there, I'd been to the Turquoise Lodge. My wife was gettin' mad at me, and moved to <Farmington>. I don't remember if I told you Safford, or did I tell that one already in there? 

Cole: Yeah. 

Tanner: I'd wake up maybe at Newcomb's or in Sheep Springs. I'd start out to go see 'em, but I'd get too drunk and pass out on the road and wake up, and I'd have to get back home. The good Lord had to be lookin' out after me to not have a head-on [accident] and stuff. I finally got back into the trading center. I think I just sold it up on my own. At Yah-Tah-Hey, what happened was, Uncle Don loaned me $6,000 to go through Turquoise Lodge for two weeks. At the time I went through it, that first time it was $180. The State subsidized it some way, if you was a resident. And then all the Navajos, we started to gettin' them in there, and the tribe, that's all they had to pay, if they was from <New Mexico>. <Arizona>, I think, is $380 or somethin'. We were really haulin' those Indians over there to get sobered up. And they had these A.A. meetings. I didn't think I got that in this tape, did I? 

Underhill: You just mentioned that your wife had moved into town. That was the only part of it. 

Tanner: So at the time when all of this hope, strength, and experiences I could share with 'em, through _______ that I've mentioned here. Every chapter house had these A.A. groups. But over here at Marbrook's [phonetic spelling], that [<Cuba>?] Highway to <Farmington>, D. B. Clark runnin' that charter service. I'd charter a plane and four or five of us would--had Navajos and one thing and another, and maybe one ___________. State police would block the traffic off and we'd land on the highway and go to a meeting and come back. And then MacDonald messed that up. He hired social drinkers to run all the alcoholic program, and all the A.A.'s. We're just now gettin' started back pretty good again. But that's the ups and downs of things, just like I've had ups and downs in the tradin' business, from <Ganado> and <Aneth> and all.

But finally, at Yah-Tah-Hey we got sobered up there. I stayed sober seven years. The early seventies was a jewelry boom. When it was all done, I didn't owe anybody anything, and had all kinds of money and jewelry and stuff paid for. I conned myself, the obsession of my mind convinced me that now with no pressure--and I didn't consult Lorraine--if I'd have consulted her, she could have told me different--but I decided I could social drink, and started back on a five-year 'nother go-around, in and out of hospitals, in and out of hospitals. A.A.'s will help you if you try to help yourself. I'd always make sure that I didn't call the same one twice, to get me in the hospital or something. I'd get someplace where I could get a new one.

Finally, I did get sobered up, and when I did, Yah- Tah-Hey, I owed quite a bit of money here and there. So I took a guy in partners with me in the real estate, by the name of Elliott Master [phonetic spelling]. His nationality was Jewish. There's a lot of good Jewish people, but there's a lot of 'em that the dollar is their god. So he was going to do these great things, develop it. I had it all ready to develop, in housing and apartments and a big shopping center. I'd spent $250,000 in the planning stages. And the City of Gallup, I drilled the first well out there. They call it the Yah-Tah-Hey Water Field. And I had the granddaddy water act, so they run a six-inch line from their treatment plant on the right there, on Yah-Tah- Hey, over to my place. That's to keep the tank full forever and ever. And I ended up selling Yah-Tah-Hey here four years ago, to Jerry Clayton [phonetic spelling]. And this Elliott Master hadn't done one thing that he'd agreed to do, and I found out later he had done the same thing to a lot of people. He gets 'em in a bind and then he gets you in. So at the present time, when I sold it, and I sold it to Jerry Clayton, Thriftway station. Then he sold it to Giant-- Jerry sold the Thriftway stations. They didn't sell Yah-Tah-Hey to Giant.

That's when I decided, well, I've got to repay these Navajos. I've got a lot of experiences here that I can share with them, maybe through a talk show on the radio. And I started it on KGAK, one hour on Friday, every Friday at one o'clock. That's when their Navajo Hours started, in the afternoon, started at one. I had one hour on there. And then on Friday at five o'clock at KYVA, that only reached about a fifty-mile radius, when all the workers was gettin' off work, so you got a captured audience, and the older people was listenin' to KGAK. It's a program that's designed to give 'em hope: there is hope. I tell 'em (in Navajo), "___________, you can't feel sorry for yourself, 'cause nobody else is gonna help you if you don't want to help yourself--whether you're an alcoholic or not. You've still got to get up and--like your old ancestors did when they came back from Fort Sumner." I tell 'em that your great-great-grandfathers and grandmothers, they walked all the way back, and were just as happy as they could be. They were just happy to be free. So many of 'em died down there, but still, they were coming home to the four sacred mountains. They needed somebody that could tell 'em in such a way that they didn't look at it that you were tryin' to boss 'em around or anything, or like some of their leaders they elect as councilmen and so forth. After the election is over, they get pretty belligerent, some of 'em, promisin' they're gonna do this and that, and then they just take care of it all. But the Navajo people in general, in my opinion, are not like the Pueblo Indians, and I'm not downgradin' the Pueblo Indians. The Navajo people lived scattered out and had to haul water and go get wood when it was scarce. They would rather work than to have welfare. I would say 90 percent of 'em back in the old days would rather work. But when President Johnson come in with the Great Society, and Peter MacDonald got elected, and they had ONEO, they called it, every Navajo that wanted a job, had it, but it was federal money for about five, six, seven years. And when it was all finally run out, instead of 'em gettin' some industry out here with that money, and some permanent jobs, there wasn't no job, nothing. And there's this lady down to <Chinle>, __________ we called her, I asked her, "Out of all that money, what's the difference in <Chinle>?" She thought a little bit and she said, "_________, my boy, I don't really.... Oh, yes, that one windmill that pumps water down there. That was put in with that ONEO money. It's still pumpin' water." That's the only thing that's left. But the Navajos had a great opportunity there with all that federal help. And for alcoholism, they had all kinds of money for treatment centers, but you can't hire social drinkers--they made mistakes there.

But one thing I didn't bring out with Yah-Tah-Hey. The Navajo Community College. Dean Jackson was president. I don't know whether you've got his name or not, as president of Navajo Community College. And I'll make this statement so you know how important this is. If we could have went on with it, the Navajo Community College would have more money comin' in than Stanford or Notre Dame--they'd have been up in that class. And Dean Jackson--he was a fantastic guy--he could see how we could do it. I told him we'd do two things: We'd take all the Navajo rugs and jewelry and stuff I could get together and we'd have a big auction at <Washington DC>, and invite President Reagan and Nancy. And when they come in and see all this stuff, just inventory, and what the college is tryin' to do, they're not sayin', "gimmee, gimmee, gimmee," they're out there makin' money, and givin' people opportunity that a lot of people in <Europe> and the East Coast and <Japan> and <Asia>, they'd like to help the Navajo if they knew how, but who's gonna give 'em a way to do it? And we was usin' the Navajo weavings mainly, because that's what the Navajos is really known for, is their Navajo weavings. And I gathered up the largest inventory that's ever been put together, because when we go and get President Reagan and Nancy to come, $100 million wouldn't buy the advertisement, them just walkin' in. Every reporter in the country that could, would be there. So after that show, when we got <New York>, <Miami>, <Boston>, and then on to <Europe>, wherever we went, before we got there, they'd know about it, just from this first show. Today, the Navajo people couldn't have made enough rugs. It was gonna include all Zunis and Santa Domingos, and all their jewelry in it, promote it with 'em. And the reason I used the college is because I had President Dean Jackson that understood that the only way that we could have a great college on the reservation is on hiring the right kind of teachers, was do it just like Stanford and Notre Dame done--they got people backin' it and helpin' it. Maybe some of 'em donated fifty dollars.... (tape turned off and on) 

Cole: So you were telling us about your idea of selling the rugs in <Washington DC> 

Tanner: (aside about dead battery) Let's see, where was I at now? 'Cause this is real important. 

Cole: You were working with Dean Jackson to try to get this rug and jewelry sale in <Washington DC> 

Tanner: I was gettin' up that big inventory. 

Cole: Right. 

Tanner: Like I was tellin' you, Brad, this was probably the biggest thing that I ever come up with. Today we'd have all these hotels out there. They could have beautiful lakes, fishing, and skiing back up on the mountain there. And there would be no excuse for any Indian, whether Navajo or what, not to be able to make a living, doing their own arts and crafts, doing what they know how to do. And Dean Jackson had enough foresight to go along with it. Even some of 'em on the board of regents was doubtful, he convinced 'em. He said, "Leaders come like Paul Jones was with the council." They sold us Piñon, I mentioned Paul Jones. And that's what we need today, and I'm workin' on that, gettin' Paul Jones-type leader. But anyway, to get this in here, when I mentioned to really get the enthusiasm goin', that we had approached President Reagan and Nancy and we had got the indication they'd definitely be there, just let 'em know, 'cause that's what Reagan ________ some people didn't like him, but I just loved him because he believed people should get up and do what [needed to be done (Tr.)]. And this college thing just flabbergasted him, that these people would come up with it, ______ market their own stuff. And what this did, like say we were hittin' onto after this show, the media really supported the college, because when they do it like this, the media is supporting the youth that's gonna learn now. And that's the reason all of our big colleges have the means they do, is through support from the medias. And we was tyin' it in, and President Reagan was gonna help us kick it off, just unbelievable the way it would have went.

I don't know whether any of you knew Wanda MacDonald, MacDonald's wife. She's a fantastic woman, but she's not [dreed take noma?]. I don't think MacDonald would have done what he done if it hadn't of been for her. She demanded that I--if the First Lady of the United States is going to come to this show, the First Lady of Navajoland should be representin' the weavers and doin' the show with you. I said, "Wanda, that's not the name of the game. This whole thing is workin' because the media supports the college. They ain't gonna support J. B. and the First Lady of Navajoland. No way. That's all there is to it. We spent, I think while I was gatherin' that inventory up, it was almost three years that I was gatherin' up this inventory, because you've got to have a fantastic display. We'd have all sixteen categories of the rugs, and a weaver for each one: Two Grey Hills, <Ganado>, and [Ward Rounds?], and so on, around this big ballroom. President Reagan and Nancy come around and shake hands with each weaver. And the media.... It was unbelievable how this was gonna work. And MacDonald just backed off, and he said, "J. B., you've got to work with Wanda. She can funnel it through all the...." I said, "Mac, it just won't work that way. Something tells me it's just not right." So the very next morning after that meeting in his office, he fired Dean Jackson, the president, and the board of regents, cleaned out. He said, "Now, J. B., you got nobody to work with." I said, "Mac, you can't mean that. These kids that's not even born is who this is gonna be for. They'll have the best teachers in the whole world. We can have the best educational institution that these people deserve. And the best markets for all the stuff they produce. It's a two-fold thing: it's for the weavers and it's for all the families that make jewelry, all the [floss?]." We had a big booth at these auctions where it had all this information about the college and how they could donate to it. Over in <Europe>--I don't know whether you guys know this or not-- but there's families over there that put up tepees and act like they're Indian. They really would support something like that.

And the little guy that helped me, I gotta get him in there. And I don't know whether he's not a drunk yet or not. But John Plane [phonetic spelling], little bitty Navajo that went to school at this Indian school up here in <Farmington>. He'd set down and talk about doing something, when we were having these first auctions, trying to recruit. Went all over <Canada>, <Colorado>, <California>, <Texas>, having shows here to get organized before we could do those bigger ones. And Little John played a big part in it. I don't know where he's at right now, and haven't been able to find out. His dad died drunk, and he always had the fear of it. But he was just one of 'em that couldn't.... My kid brother Rick, A.A.'s for guys like me. I had to liquidate all that inventory and pay off the banks. As I got more inventory, I was able to borrow more, and the auctions was turnin' money in.

We set one up in <Kansas City> like we was gonna set it up in Washington, with weavin' [and freight?], just before Mac done that. I walked in that ballroom, for some reason I didn't go back ___________, I started to play and threw it back down and _________. I walked in and I had bought every one of those rugs from traders or Indians, and it took my breath. Navajo weavings are beautiful when they're all categoried, all Two Grey Hills together, Ganados, and vegetable dyes, and <Teec Nos Pos>. There's sixteen different kinds. And today, I don't think there'd be a college that Notre Dame and Stanford--everybody knows how well-off they are. They can do anything they want to do. Catholic Church really backs Notre Dame, and Stanford is mostly big business people. And Mac blowed it.

This is the last thing I want to say on that. It ended up that Dean Jackson, it killed him. His dream just rolled up there. He had cancer and didn't know it, but I think the stress and everything brought it on, and when you go over to Ellis' to take his, Ellis ___________, he's got portraits of different leaders, council members and so forth, up on the wall that's been painted. And Dean Jackson's there--take a look at it.

Well, here I am settin' here sharing this with you guys. I darned near died with pneumonia in April, my hair all come out, and I thought I was gonna be bald- headed for sure. But it's growin' back now. And I just cut my radio show off. The first of April I made four years. I started on April first, four years ago April. But the doctor told me if I didn't quit runnin' back and forth to <Window Rock> to do it, that they couldn't cure this pneumonia. And I darned near didn't do it in time.

The point I want to bring out on that is, here MacDonald, he's in jail, federal penitentiary, and if I'd have went with Wanda, the way he done all the finances and everything, buyin' that ranch--it's fantastic, I don't know where he's got all that money hid--but I'd have been in jail with him, probably, for [a load of?] this stuff. And Dean, bless his heart, I love him to death, the tribe did dedicate the arena at <Window Rock> where they have a Navajo Nation Fair, as Dean Jackson Arena. His daughters is really barrel racers, and his brothers and he ______ cowboy before he took the job up there.

But I've mentioned several times about in here, the good Lord sure looked after me. He had my Grandpa Joe teach me Navajo, all these different times crazy airplane deals that they plowed the ground soft. Had it been otherwise, it wouldn't have flipped over just right. And just countless times. I've always said the very worst tragedy in your life, there's some good to it if you'll just look hard enough. The good Lord has it happen for a reason. Well, I've been able to say that's true, in everything that's happened to me: goin' broke three times, and [and go clear to the basin?], the Navajo people bailed me out. Weigh the lambs in the tub and all that kind of stuff to get you goin' again. Still, like John-John, when I left home there, and looked over there and come back and held him, he said, "Me say God, Daddy, stay me." I knew right then that's the reason God gave him to [us]. Then Lorraine quit havin' any nervous breakdowns, and didn't have to take those darned shock treatments and get rid of her memory.

So the point I'd like to share with everybody that might have access to this is, your Heavenly Father will help you if you try to help yourself, and try to help others. And I think the only reason I've been able to even think about puttin' a deal together like the college deal with the auctions and stuff, and be able to have it that [close?], within ninety days at the most, of kicking it off, I haven't been able to figure out what good has come out of it, because not only the education for the people, but all of the income that any kid growing up, all they gotta do is get Grandma and Grandpa to teach 'em how to silversmith and make a rug or what have you. There'd have been people from all over the world that would donate to those. You know how people do, they send $500 a year to a college, or some of those rich people they saw, $100,000 a year. And you can just imagine, like from <Japan> and all over, all the rich people in <Europe> and the East Coast. And just tell 'em _____________ how close we got. And we had President Reagan ready to go. And he couldn't believe MacDonald had done that.

But Brad, I don't know of anything else I can add to my story. I didn't bring that out until the end. I didn't get to do the greatest idea that I wanted to do for those people. If you could have just seen 'em, just that one time when I bought Yah-Tah-Hey and had to weigh those lambs in a tub, and we had big scales. And people laughin' and havin' fun doin' it. That's loyalty. The Navajo people are just like the Alcoholic Anonymous fellowship. You don't wait, you go do it, somebody asks for help. You get up and you go help.

Thank you, Brad. 

Cole: Thank you. 

Tanner: One of these days if I live long enough, I'll figure out somethin' good about that. The only thing I can say now is, out of the three of us, Mac's down there dyin', had heart surgery; Dean, he's already passed on. But it's probably the good there was that it just tore him up so bad that he could see Notre Dame and Stanford out there on that mountainside. The hell of it was, I could see it, and every time I go out there, I just get sick. They haven't even repaired the thing out there--the college is about to go under. One of these days, we'll know.
