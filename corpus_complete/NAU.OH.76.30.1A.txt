C. L. Harkins- Part 1

Interviewed by John Bury

November 16, 1974



Tr.’s note:  Lots of air roar, poor recording quality.



Bury:  We’re interviewing Dr. C. L. Harkins.  This is November 16, [1974].  Dr. Harkins, I’d like you to start off with the first question on the questionnaire.  I’d like to get a description of your background, as far as where you were born, under what conditions, your early schoolhouse memories, why did you go into education, your first career at <McNary>, I believe, when you started in a one-room schoolhouse.  I started my teaching in a one-room schoolhouse.  I’d like to get all this down.

Harkins:  Okay.  Well, John, it’s a pleasure to visit with you and to review my life.  I’ve lived a long time, so it could be a very long story!  (chuckles)

Bury:  Alright.  I’ve got lots of tape.

Harkins:  I was born in <Roscoe Texas>, on the eighth day of December 1907.  <Roscoe> is a small town about eight miles west of <Sweetwater>, fifty miles west of <Abilene Texas>.  My parents were both born in Central <Texas>.  My mother’s folks came from <Georgia>, from <Ireland> to <Georgia>.  And my father’s folks came from England to <Alabama>-some of them from <Ireland> also.  My father was a freighter and a peace officer in the early days in <Roscoe>.

Bury:  What would you mean by freighter-a truck driver?

Harkins:  Oh, they didn’t have trucks in those days.  He had freight wagons and hauled building supplies and helped build some of the small towns near, in the vicinity of <Roscoe> and <Sweetwater>.  We moved from <Roscoe> when I was about four years old, and we moved in a covered wagon from West <Texas> to Central <Texas>.  I remember very well, although I was pretty young, and there’s considerable doubt in the minds of my older brothers and sisters that I did remember [unclear], that I just heard them talk about it until I thought I remembered it.  But I really do remember part of the trip from West <Texas> to Central <Texas>.  We lived in the country in Central <Texas> about eight or ten miles from <Waco>, in a small town called <Hewitt>.

Bury:  How do you spell that?

Harkins:  H-E-W-I-T-T.  I started to school there.  It was a small-town school.  That’s the only school I went to in my elementary and high school days.

Bury:  How small a school?  Was it a one-room, or was it bigger?

Harkins:  No, it was probably, as I remember, about an eight or ten-teacher school.  That’s the only school I ever went to in the small town of <Hewitt>.  I graduated from there, and we graduated from those rural high schools in those days with two years of high school.  I only went through-I graduated from high school in the tenth grade, so-called.  They only had eleven grades in high schools in <Texas>.

Bury:  So you weren’t very old then.

Harkins:  Well, I didn’t start until I was seven, and I was eight in December when I started.  I went through those ten years, and when I finished in the spring of 1925, I was eighteen years old.  I was seventeen-and-a-half.  Actually I was seventeen, wasn’t eighteen until the following December.  We lived about, seems to me like two-and-a-half, three miles from town, on a big farm, and we all worked.  I had nine brothers and sisters.  We worked early and late.  On the farm we raised everything that they raised in Central <Texas> in those days.  We raised corn and cotton and wheat and oats and vegetables.  I was a farm boy until I was seventeen years old.  I think the last two or perhaps the last three years in school, we moved to town in a big two-story house, and continued in the same school, of course.  We operated a big farm in that community.

Bury:  Let me ask you a question at this point.  We say in education that you teach as you were taught.  You went on to be a teacher, and of course a very significant leader in education later.  Is there anything during this time of elementary and high school education that you particularly remember as far as the experience?  Was there anything outstanding about your education, or was it just nothing singularly that you would remember about it, as far as affecting you later?

Harkins:  I can remember very well being whipped on the hands with a ruler because I was left-handed.  My primary teacher tried to change my writing from left to right, but she didn’t succeed.  But as a result, I don’t write upside down like most left-handed people do.  I write just like everybody, but I use my left hand.  I was a good student in history and math and English, as I remember.  I liked science.  I was [unclear] sports, played all kinds of sports.  We didn’t have football at our school, but we played basketball and baseball, volleyball, and I was on the track team and things like that.  There were only about ten people in my graduating class.  I was probably second or third in standing.  I can remember the superintendent of the school was a very close friend of mine, and I dropped out of high school.  He and I had the same birthday, and the day I was sixteen, he was thirty-two.  He had a great influence on my life.  When I was in my last year of high school, I got mad at my other teachers.  I was a discipline problem on a few occasions, and got a lot of paddlings, and got another one when I got home, and I dropped out of school.  I stayed out a couple of days, and my mother talked me into going back.  And this school principal encouraged me, and I did finish.  He quit teaching the year I was a senior, and became a Methodist minister.  And he talked me into doing the same thing.  I was quite active in the church [unclear], Methodist Church.  So when I left home that fall, we were in some kind of a depression.  It was in the early twenties, after the post-World War I boom, and were in a depression, and my dad took us up to East <Texas> that year to work.  The whole family went on a cotton-picking tour.  We went to <Commerce Texas>, and while I was there, I decided to go to school there.  So they left me there, and I went to Commerce to East Texas State because I wanted to be a teacher, and worked my way through college that way.  In the old days in <Texas>, you could teach if you graduated from the normal schools, some college.  Actually, you took psychology and educational courses, and procedures courses and so forth at the same time you took eleventh-grade work.  So you got a high school degree, high school diploma, and a certificate to teach at the same time.

Bury:  So it wasn’t like you had to have a high school degree and then you did the two years of normal school-you did both at the same [time].

Harkins:  One year of normal school.  I could have taught, being a high school graduate.

Bury:  At that time <Arizona> had higher requirements then.

Harkins:  Oh yes, this was in 1925.

Bury:  Because <Arizona> required a two-year normal school certificate.

Harkins:  Right.

Bury:  You said your folks were on a cotton-picking tour.  Does this mean they were going around, following, picking the cotton wherever needed as they travelled through the state?

Harkins:  Right.

Bury:  That must have been quite a life for you.

Harkins:  Oh boy, it was gruesome.  So anyway, I left the family there in September 1925, and started to sub-college at East Texas State.  I worked for a millionaire doctor, and my roommate and I lived in a garage apartment.  I worked with him, built the fires in the furnace, and I also worked in a church as a janitor, a Presbyterian church, to pay my expenses.  I still planned to enter Southern Methodist University after I had taught a year or two, and study the ministry.  Well, some things happened in my life that year that caused me to change my plans, and so in the spring of ’26, I left school and left on a hitchhiking tour of the country, and worked at odd jobs, and just sort of bummed around through <New Mexico> and <Arkansas> and <Oklahoma>.  Finally I decided to go back home, and so in the summer of ’26 I went back home.  The family accepted me back into the family circle.

Bury:  Where were they now?

Harkins:  They were still living in <Hewitt Texas>.  (brief interruption, recording paused)

Bury:  I just noticed one thing, that you were born in the same year that Skipper Dick was, and you were both born in <Texas>.  Did you ever run into each other?  (both speaking at once, neither discernable)  He speaks very well of you.

Harkins:  I worked very closely with him.  In fact, I gave him all of my material when I left the state for the foreign service-gave him all my list of names [unclear 00:12:46] when he was the county superintendent here.

Bury:  Well, we’ve got you bumming around the country, and you just went back home to <Hewitt Texas>.

Harkins:  Went back home to help the folks.  The family fortunes didn’t improve any.  I was the oldest one at home, and we moved back to West <Texas>.  I went back with the folks in the fall of ’26, and they settled in Hanson [phonetic], <Texas>.  It’s about twenty-five miles north of <Abilene>.  I stayed with Dad and Mother through the fall work season on the farm, and left home again at Christmas time and went to <Kingsville Texas>, where my older sister lived.  Her husband was in the construction business, and <Kingsville> was a new community and booming, a lot of country out south of <Corpus Christi>.  I thought maybe I could go to school there, so they said they’d help me get a job.  I was determined to get an education, so I was home again in January of ’27, and went to <Kingsville> and worked there and stayed there and went to school at South Texas State Teachers College, and finished my sophomore college year.  So actually my high school diploma is a certificate from South Texas State Teachers College in <Kingsville Texas>.

Bury:  That’s <Kingsville>, or Keansville?

Harkins:  <Kingsville>, home of the King Ranch, Santa Gertrudis.

Bury:  So you were certified to teach actually then when you graduated, weren’t you-for <Texas>, that is.

Harkins:  Yes, I could have taught, but I didn’t.  I left <Kingsville> and I had changed my mind about teaching and decided I got interested in [unclear], although I worked my way living there by jerking soda [unclear].  But anyway, I left <Kingsville>.  Mom and Dad wanted me to come back home [unclear] their home in West <Texas> and just stayed a little while and took off for <California>.  [unclear] for a long time.  I decided I wanted to be a petroleum engineer.  Well, I hitchhiked to <California>.  I came through <Arizona> on the hitchhiking deal, and had quite an experience through <Bisbee>, which would take hours to tell, but a man gave me a ride out of <Las Cruces New Mexico>, across the line at <Naco>, which was just [unclear] from <Bisbee>.  And while there, he got drunk, and I got scared and took off.  I walked from <Naco> to <Bisbee>, up the railroad.  I don’t know what happened to him.  I stayed maybe a couple of days and couldn’t find out anything, so I took off [unclear].  I walked up to the top of the Mule Mountain Pass down in <Bisbee>, and caught a ride to <Tucson>, then hitchhiked on to <Phoenix>.  Took me a day or so, because the rides were short, it was hot, it was in August.  I spent one night in the desert, sleeping under a mesquite tree between <Florence> and the prison.  I remember very well seeing the lights of the prison.  It was August of ’27.  In 1955, I was a member of the pardon and parole board, [unclear] convicts [unclear].

Bury:  That’s right, you would be a superintendent [unclear].

Harkins:  So anyway, I came on to <Phoenix>.  I got hungry, very hungry, didn’t have any money.  I walked most of the way from <Florence> to <Phoenix>, as I remember, and caught a ride with a deputy sheriff that dropped me off in front of the capitol.  The old road went by the capitol, you know, Highway 80, Van Buren.  I stopped off there and took my shoes off and washed my feet in an irrigation canal and caught a ride that evening down to Buckeye and Hassayampa.  At Hassayampa I walked all the way out to the <Hassayampa River>, from Buckeye, and met an old prospector out there and asked him what he was doing, and he said, "Well, I’ve been walkin’ up and down these washes twenty-five years, looking for work, and hoping to hell I wouldn’t find it."  So I went on, caught a ride to <Gila Bend>.  I remember crossing the Gila River.  Gillespie Dam was rather new, and there was water in the Gila, I remember that.  Anyway, I caught a ride to <Gila Bend>, and from there I caught a ride to <California>, and I spent ’27, worked six months in the oil fields.  I was still determined to get [unclear] engineering.  I became more interested in the oil [unclear] business.  And I saved my money for six months, and so I went back to <Texas> to the university in January of ’28.

Bury:  This would be the University of Austin?

Harkins:  Yeah, <Austin>.  So I went there one semester, ran out of money again, and decided to go back to <California> in the summer of ’28, to continue my work.  So I went back and got a job, went back into the oil fields, and I was working in Santa Fe Springs, [unclear] big boom there.  I got in good with the officials of the building department, and they let me work the night shift, so I went to Fullerton Junior College, and I finished Fullerton Junior College that way.  Graduated from junior college in January of 1930.

Bury:  Fullerton wasn’t a very old school, they’d just started that school.

Harkins:  But anyway, I lived [unclear] Brea, [unclear], Fullerton, and worked from four in the evening ’til midnight.  [unclear]  I became a specialist in cementing oil wells, worked on cementing crews, so that I wouldn’t have to change shifts, because [unclear] two weeks on one shift, and then they’d change to another shift [unclear] same shift all the time.  So I became a specialist in cementing work just on cementing oil wells.  I got an idea for a cementing tool that I worked out with a driller.  About that time, the [Great] Depression came, fall of ’29.  Of course before I could get the idea developed, I lost my job.  All the single men were laid off first.  So I finished that semester and got my two-year certificate from Fullerton Junior College in January 1930, and was without a job, so I took off for <Texas> again.

Bury:  Did you take an education course at Fullerton?  Was this education preparation, or was it liberal arts?

Harkins:  No, [unclear] liberal arts, and what science I could take.  I took physics and so on [unclear] engineering course.  But I took liberal arts there.  Actually, when I was at the University of Texas, I began to feel or realize that I couldn’t work and make my own living [unclear] expenses, and do science and math and do lab work.  I just didn’t have time [unclear].  So I went back to....  In 1928, going back a little bit, after I left the University of Texas, I went to <Flagstaff> with a friend of mine who was going to summer school at <Flagstaff>.  And I fell in love with Flag and probably would have stayed there if I could have gotten a job.  Flag was a small town of about 3,500 people.  The school was small, only 300-400 students.  It was in the summertime that I was there.  But anyway, I stayed around Flag a week or so, then went on to <California>, where I stayed until 1930.  In 1930, when I went back to <Texas>, I worked for the Mexican Petroleum Corporation out in West <Texas> again, and lived in the same community with one of my brothers who was a railroad agent [unclear] and his family.  I was working in the Mexican Petroleum Corporation and instead of putting me in [unclear] the railroad repair shop.  Well, I didn’t like that, so in May of 1928 until May of 1930, I said I was going to go back to school.  I’d finished junior college.  If I couldn’t get a degree in engineering or in petroleum geology, why, I would go into teaching.  That was my first love, my first plan back in 1925.  So then the latter part of May of 1930, I took off for <Flagstaff>.  I arrived on the first day of June 1930.  Moved into the College Inn downtown [unclear] season [unclear] season, my optometrist was the soda jerk.  He was the first man I met.  I had him make me a milkshake.

Bury:  Tell me his name now so I get it right.

Harkins:  Willis Easley, E-A-S-L-E-Y.  He’s Dr. Willis Easley here in <Phoenix>.  We’ve been friends ever since.

Bury:  Now, the College Inn was where?

Harkins:  It was called The Candy Box, right across from the old Pine Hotel, next to the barber shop and the alley, right by the old city hall-it was used as a city hall-it was Judge Pulliams’ office, next to the alley.

Bury:  Where was it [unclear] the Weatherford?

Harkins:  Across the street from the Weatherford Hotel.

Bury:  Okay.  Let me ask you an important question:  by this point had you learned to play cribbage?

Harkins:  No, I didn’t learn to play cribbage until the fall of 1930.  And then I worked my way through college the last two years playing cribbage!

Bury:  Right, that’s what I’ve heard.  That’s a beautiful board.

Harkins:  My granddaughter bought that in <Hawaii>.

Bury:  I’ve heard about your cribbage playing.

Harkins:  I had two roommates that were really great cribbage players.  Both of 'em are dead.  Anyway....

Bury:  How did you find <Flagstaff>?

Harkins:  Well, I found it just like I wanted it.  It was a small town.  Summer school was great, people from all over the country there.  I made a lot of wonderful friends.  One of 'em I remember very well-John Russell, who helped me quite a bit, because I had a car and I had to sell the car in order to go to school.  I had to go to <California> to sell it, so he loaned me the money and I went to <California> to sell my car and got a little money out of it; came back [unclear] school.  John Russell and Kenneth Bishop, two really great people, were my closest friends in those days.  And I met Weaver Mettis [phonetic].  Weaver Mettis was sort of the athletic manager, and he helped me get a job.  I had been a pretty fair basketball, baseball player in high school.  I guess he thought I could add something to the athletic department up there.  So anyway, I got a job, stayed in <Flagstaff> from June of 1930 until I finished my three-year diploma, and then went out to teach school in December of ’31.  I graduated with a three-year diploma in December.  They were on the quarter system in <Flagstaff> at that time.  And of course Dr. Grady Gammage was very kind to me and probably the reason that I was [able to] stay in school in the depths of the Depression.  I got 35¢ an hour for working on campus.  I got a job carrying the school mail.  In the fall of 1930, there were 451 students in school.  I was taking journalism, and I wrote the story for the paper that fall, the attendance story.

Bury:  This would be the Pine?

Harkins:  Yeah, uh-huh.  Anyway, Dr. Gammage made it possible for me to stay in school, and I met my first wife up there [unclear] freshman from [unclear].  I went out for the football team, and I had to carry the mail, a conflict, and I had to quit.  Thought I couldn’t quit the job, so I had to quit the football team.

Bury:  Times have changed!

Harkins:  Yeah.  I played one game with University of New Mexico and Mexico State.  I dropped football, and I started out for basketball later, and [unclear] and I had a little argument [unclear] history.  Anyway, I dropped basketball [unclear].

Bury:  What was it like....  Looking back here, you’re a professional educator, and you have your doctorate in the field of education.  What was the education program like that you took for that year-and-a-half while you were there?  Was it instrumental?  Was it valuable?  Was it of use when you went later into the classroom?  What do you remember of it?

Harkins:  Well, actually I took educational psychology at the University of Texas in 1928.  That was one of my first courses that I can remember where I really got something out of human growth and development.  I got a little bit about [unclear] personality, got a little bit about procedures.  But the year-and-a-half, from June of ’30 until December of ’31, that I went out to teach, I took all of the procedures courses that I could get:  how to teach math in elementary school, how to teach reading, how to teach English.  They had those courses in those days.  I remember Doc Lundsford didn’t have a bachelor’s degree, but we called him Doc.  He was my teacher, he and, oh, Mrs....  She’s still over there.  Raspberry or....

Bury:  Roseberry?

Harkins:  [Minnie] Roseberry.  She was my elementary teacher.

Bury:  Really?  Oh my gosh.

Harkins:  We had to take fundamentals of art and fundamentals of music-you know, music appreciation, art appreciation, all those things were in elementary course curriculum [unclear].  And that was the time that I really learned something about education, about the fundamentals of primary education, the principles of teaching and curriculum and so forth.  Very rudimentary, I would say-very elementary, as we know it today.  But anyway, that was my first recollections of really something that had to do with teaching.  We had classroom management and all of the principles of secondary education-all of these things that today, I don’t know if they’re given the same impetus or the same importance now.  But to me, those days, they were the heart of the teacher training program.  <Flagstaff> was still an ordinance depot [unclear] state college I think about 1930 or something like that.

Bury:  Yeah, it was in the middle thirties they made it into a teachers’ college.

Harkins:  I went to teach in a one-room school the first week in December of 1931 in <McNary>, in the lumber camp.  It was seven miles from town, and the teacher there got pregnant.  All eight grades, twenty-two children.  I realized very quickly that I needed practical [unclear] about how to teach.

Bury:  Okay, now you had a one-room school-a logging camp, one-room school, and you had all eight grades.

Harkins:  Twenty-two children.

Bury:  That’s exactly how I started my career was in a logging camp in <Alaska>.  I started in the middle of the year, it was January.  I had all eight grades.

Harkins:  [unclear]

Bury:  I only had thirteen kids, but I sure realized I didn’t know much.

Harkins:  Well, I didn’t keep the twenty-two very long.  The camp was going up and down and moving around, but I had, as I remember, about seventeen.  So the first week or the second week, [unclear] anxious to go back to <Flagstaff> to see my girlfriend.  She was in school up there.  And so I went back as soon as possible to talk to Dr. Lundsford and to talk to Minnie Roseberry.  I got a full day almost on a Saturday-went up Friday night-had to catch a ride with another teacher to <Holbrook>.  That first trip we made took us all afternoon, half a day, to go from <McNary> to <Holbrook>, because we got stuck so many times [unclear].  In fact, <Show Low> had maybe about three business houses.

Bury:  It was paved from <Holbrook> into Flag, wasn’t it-Old 66?

Harkins:  Yeah.  But I caught this ride and took a bus from <Holbrook> into <Flagstaff>.  I spent all day Saturday with Doc Lundsford and Minnie Roseberry.  And they pointed how I could combine some of the groups and some of the grades and some of the classes, and so I put this [unclear, laughing] conducting five classes and eight grades all the time.  So I put 'em together.  Anyway, we managed to have a pretty good year. I can remember one particular incident that indicated how primitive and isolated those people were.  I had the largest boy in school was in about sixth grade.  I was attempting to teach him some geography.  I was planning to draw a parallel between the time it took Lindbergh to cross the ocean, and the time that it took a ship [unclear] air transportation and ship transportation.  His question was, "Well, Mr. Harkins, who was Lindbergh?"  That was the spring of ’31, four years after [unclear].  He had never heard of Lindbergh.  They didn’t have newspapers or magazines.  These kids moved from one lumber camp to another, and they rarely got to town.  In fact, I can remember a train passing-I was on a railroad car, and I lived in this car.  I had a little section of a car and a cot in there, and a wood stove.  I lived there, and I cut the wood.  I got $10 a month for cutting the wood, and $125 for teaching school.  So I made $135 a month.  Then I had to pay a good percentage of that to get [unclear] checks weren’t any good.

Bury:  That’s right, it was what, 10 to 20 percent discount?

Harkins:  About 10 percent, as I remember.  I couldn’t even cash 'em in <McNary>.  I had to go all the way to <Springerville> or St. Johns to get the checks cashed.  Well, that was my first year.  They closed the school at the end of that year, so I didn’t have a job after that.  There wasn’t any job there, but I went from there to <Wellton> the next fall.

Bury:  Now <Wellton> is down near <Yuma>?

Harkins:  Thirty-two miles east of <Yuma>.  I went to <Yuma> the second year [unclear] teacher.  The end of the year, the principal was fired and I was made the principal and the seventh-eighth-grade teacher.  I stayed there four years as the principal and seventh and eighth-grade teacher.  In 1936 I was elected the county school superintendent.

Bury:  Okay, so ’32 to ’36 you were at <Wellton>.

Harkins:  Right.

Bury:  What grade did you start as?

Harkins:  The first year, fifth and sixth.

Bury:  Fifth and sixth grade.  And then you became principal and you taught the seventh and eighth grade.

Harkins:  And athletics and shop and drove the bus, which I got $155 for.

Bury:  Wow.  That was pretty good pay though, back then, wasn’t it?

Harkins:  Yes.  There were 300-400 men on every freight train that went through town.  They had my house marked, and as many as ten of 'em at a time would come there asking for something to eat.  [unclear] "Grapes of Wrath" [unclear].

Bury:  Was that a major highway at that time?

Harkins:  [unclear] front of my house [unclear] cut through town.

Bury:  You ran for county superintendent....

Harkins:  ... of <Yuma County> in 1936.  I was [unclear] re-elected in ’38 and ’40.

Bury:  Let me get the political affiliation.  You ran, I assume, then as a Democrat.  Why did you decide to be a Democrat?-because this is a particular time in history....

Harkins:  [unclear] Democratic state, and there wasn’t any other party in <Texas>.

Bury:  No, there really wasn’t in <Arizona> either, was there, at that time?

Harkins:  No.  There were a dozen or two Republicans.

Bury:  Did the election of Franklin Roosevelt have anything to do as far as your party affiliation and the strength of it?

Harkins:  Well, I was a disciple of Roosevelt because of the conditions in the country that I thought he had something to do with changing.  I saw the worst possible effects of the Depression-"Grapes of Wrath."  They had to block the river in <Yuma> to keep what we called the Okies....  They were people [unclear] <Texas> and <Oklahoma>, trying to get to the land of milk and honey.  [unclear] so many of 'em there already that they blocked the river.

Bury:  Now this was done by the Californians there at <Yuma>, so they couldn’t go across the bridge?

Harkins:  Well, the county school superintendent in the city of [unclear] because I was supervising about fifteen one-room schools.  I had twenty-three school districts in <Yuma County>, and I think twelve or fifteen of 'em were one-room schools, and I saw all of the bad things that could happen.  [unclear] kids that were subjected to all of the political whims of the local school board that was run by one man who ran a service station, and who was the postmaster, who controlled the community, and might or might not have an official school election.  I saw all of the evils of the small rural school.  So I then decided to do something about it.  So I worked on the consolidation of school districts while I was the county superintendent, and I got on the state board of education, funded by Bob Jones in 1939, and served on the state board in 1939, 1940, representing the county superintendents on the state board.

Bury:  Right, this would be [unclear].

Harkins:  Carl Aperson [phonetic] represented the high school principals.  Leif Nelson [phonetic] represented the city school superintendents.  Carl, Leif, and I became the trio of elected republic school officials.  Then there were the college presidents of the three colleges-they were on the state board.  Then the governor and the state superintendent.  That was the eight-man board.

Bury:  Do you have any reflections on H. E. Hendricks [phonetic], who was superintendent?

Harkins:  Oh yes, very many.  He was superintendent then.

Bury:  Right.  He was for a ten-year period almost there.

Harkins:  A very strong, active individual, a very determined personality.  He probably did more to move <Arizona> education from the old rural mining town philosophy of education, to modern-day methods.  He had some outstanding people.  He had C. Louise Berringer [phonetic], who had been a county [unclear] early <Yuma>, as the curriculum director.  He had J. Morris Richards [phonetic] as director of [unclear] statistics.  He’s one of my good friends, one of the really fine people in that department.  He had Bill Harless [phonetic].  I don’t know whether he was secretary of education or....  He had a great man in <Arizona>, John Riggins [phonetic], who had been a superintendent in <Maricopa County>.  John Riggins was a [unclear] man, and he was Hendricks’ assistant.  When I was the county superintendent, John Riggins gave me a lot of guidance, gave me a lot of help.  And those three or four other people [unclear] really great leaders.  They [unclear] outstanding in making that transition from the old-type education system to more modern-day testing programs and research and statistics.  I don’t know whether you remember [unclear].  In the thirties was when the statistical binge was in full swing in Arizona education.  Everybody had to take tests and measurement in school.  There’s where we were introduced to the curve and grading on the curve.  The whole system of measurements in education then took off.  It became the thing.  Anyway, those people were the leaders in that field, and I remember also because in my association with them on the state board of education.  We had some real big fights in textbooks.  Ned Hill [phonetic] was the textbook man, and of course we ordered-had an arrangement with the textbook publishers, and they bought the [unclear] books, moved 'em into a warehouse, and then they were shipped out to the schools.  There was a big scandal in the department of education during the latter part of Herman Hendricks’ administration over the textbook deal.  That was when we started changing the system of adopting textbooks in the state.  We had a lot of big fights.  I can remember Herman Hendricks pounding on the desk and saying, "You can adopt that damned book if you want to, but I won’t buy a single one of 'em!"

Bury:  Oh yeah, I want to ask you on that, because of course you’re touching on something that’s affecting education today as we’re going through the big controversy with the state board right at this very time.  [unclear] is on that committee.

Harkins:  Who’s that?

Bury:  Ray Huitt, H-U-I-T-T.

Harkins:  I don’t know him.

Bury:  But as far as the textbooks themselves, first of all, what was the scandal about?  That’s what I’d like to know.  And then what did the argument concern?  Was it to do with the type of the textbook, the approach of the textbook, that Hendricks was either for or against?

Harkins:  Well, I was a part of the suit later that the state auditor brought [unclear] the state board.  I haven’t reviewed the material in many years.  I can’t remember all of the details, but the state superintendent got the textbooks from the textbook company; they were shipped to the textbook warehouse; and there was some kind of an arrangement with the shipping costs; and the scandal had to do with the use of stamps, mailing....  I just can’t remember the details of the thing, but you could look it up in [unclear].

Bury:  This is the same scandal when you mentioned stamps, that I know about.  This would be also directly involved with the secretary in the vocational ed department, and she was giving stamps to her church or something?

Harkins:  Right.

Bury:  Does this sound like it was the same thing?

Harkins:  Same [unclear], same thing, same administration when this happened.  Anyway, it brought Central District [unclear] state department [unclear] for several years.  That made the adoption of state textbooks sort of the center of attention.  It was also during our administration that we began to adopt more than one book.

Bury:  Multiple adoption for each subject area?

Harkins:  Right, but it wasn’t legal, in effect, because we could only adopt a textbook for....  But we adopted supplementary books [unclear].

Bury:  Why did Hendricks say you could go ahead and adopt something else but he wouldn’t pay for it?-which is his prerogative.  Did he have a difference in educational philosophy here with these textbooks?

Harkins:  Yes, he was of the old school, I think.  He was German and he was very stubborn, as I remember, and he had his own idea about the kind of books we should have in the elementary school.  If he didn’t like a book or [unclear] if his committee....  See, we had individual committees.  (both talking at same time, neither discernable)  ... committee in <Yuma>, you see.  And [unclear] had a committee in <Prescott>.  Leif Nelson had a committee in Safford.  And [unclear] committee didn’t recommend a book, why, we wouldn’t recommend it for adoption.  So I can remember the title of this book, I guess is what turned him against it.  I can’t remember it now, but it had something to do with [swirl?].  Anyway, because of the title, he didn’t like it.  [unclear] that respect.  But in basic fundamental education, I think Herman Hendricks’ administration was probably as [unclear] significant as anybody.

Bury:  Did you know that Gene Worfridge [phonetic] is in town now?  He works at <Tempe> ASU.

Harkins:  Yes.  I haven’t talked to him in some time, but I remember.

Bury:  During the time particularly when you were at <Wellton> in the field teaching as a principal, did you feel the effect of the state superintendent’s office?

Harkins:  Oh yes.

Bury:  Did they come into your classroom?  Did they work with you?  Did you feel it was a positive or a negative?  Were they in your way?

Harkins:  Oh no.  I can remember C. O. Case came to visit me when I was [unclear].  I remember it very well.  C. Louise Berry came to visit me.  It was almost like a holiday in a sense.  When I was a county superintendent, I noticed it even more so, because I was young, and probably I was the youngest county superintendent in the state at that time [unclear] about anything (laughs) I don’t think.  But anyway, I can remember Herman Hendricks spending all day with me.  I can remember the testing programs that we had.  J. Morris Richards actually came and conducted tests all over the state.  Miss Berringer and [unclear] Harlis [phonetic], Ed Hill and textbooks.  They were important people, and I think they had a very significant effect.  And if we could get the state superintendent to <Yuma> to give a speech, whether it was graduation or a workshop, we always had these....  Well, we didn’t call them workshops, but we had these kind of....

Bury:  Teacher institutes?

Harkins:  Yeah, we called them institutes.  It was a big success if we could get the state superintendent or somebody from the state department to come talk to us, work with us, and so forth.  So I think they were very significant.

Bury:  How much were you paid as county superintendent?

Harkins:  Twenty-four hundred dollars [$2,400] a year.  A little bit of an increase [unclear].

Bury:  Toward the end of Hendricks’ administration, there was a scandal.  As you’ve already mentioned, it had a lot to do with stamps, and somewhat to do with textbooks.  He also was having a personal family problem due to his second wife and an individual in the department.  And also he, I gather, was experiencing some medical problems.  There was, from what I’ve been able to put together, a period of time-maybe a year, maybe two years-where he was having a great deal of trouble with the press, with some politicians in the state.  How did this affect education?  If we’re talking about a political office, you’re still elected to get in it, and did this have some sort of effect negatively on education, or was it just something more of a private?

Harkins:  Well, I remember it very well because a guy from <Tucson> ran against Hendricks in 1938, and came in here beating him.  We thought he [unclear]-Marvin L. Burke.  He was the county superintendent of <Pima County>.  He ran against Hendricks in ’38 and came real near beating him in most of the [unclear].  I think the opposition was based on Hendricks’....  He finally married that poor gal [unclear]. I think she’s still living now.  [unclear] relationship with her [unclear] legislature.  They thought he was trying to be too powerful, and he was part of the [unclear], and they had some [unclear] case.  I can remember him telling us all about that, as a member of the parole board.

Bury:  What was his position as far as she was concerned?

Harkins:  I don’t remember.  Was he instrumental in the community, or did he have her executed?  I really don’t remember [unclear] the details [unclear].

Bury:  You’re touching on some particular areas that we’re emphasizing in this study.  This is a political office, you have to be elected to fill it.  Herman Hendricks said that he felt the office should be appointed.  He personally was very much against having to run for election.  He thought it was demeaning for an educator.  We argue about that today in <Arizona>.  How do you feel about it?  I want to make sure I get this answer from you, and I’m going to ask you in different ways, all the way through the interview.  How do you feel about this elected superintendent dealing with an appointed board?  Not only then, but compared to your own tenure when you became superintendent.

Harkins:  Well, I’ve seen it in three different cases. I saw it as a member of the board, with a strong superintendent who was elected.

Bury:  This would be Herman Hendricks?

Harkins:  Strong personality, right.  I represented the county superintendents.  I was a youngster, and probably had the least experience in the field of education of anybody on the board, and actually was impressionable by the events that were taking place.  I thought always, because of my dad’s interest in politics, I was interested very early in life, that it would be wonderful to be elected to something, to have your peers vote for you.  As a kid in <Texas>, I knew I was interested in politics.  That seemed to be a big thing in life.  You know, heroes.  There were many heroes in politics and public life as in the world of the military, because we didn’t have very many wars.

Bury:  Is this sort of a populist tradition, because you’re talking about yourself; Skipper Dick talked the same way; you can read Lyndon Johnson, you get the same feeling-sort of a very strong populist type feeling that came out of <Texas> at that time?

Harkins:  [unclear]  Plus the fact that the family life when I grew up in <Texas> was [unclear].  I had nine brothers and sisters, good family situation, good family relationship.  The loyalties, I think the values, human relationships were different than what they are today, because we lived so close together, just like in <Flagstaff>.  That’s the reason the group of people that graduated in the thirties in <Flagstaff> are still the foundation of the philosophy it’s great to be a Lumberjack.  I was at this party-I don’t know whether you were there or not-the other night over to the country club....

Bury:  No.

Harkins:  All the old-timers were there, my generation.  And we were in the profession, everybody lived in the dormitories, none of us had any money, we all had to struggle to get through-most of us-not all of us, but most of us.  It developed a kinship and friendship that has withstood the years.  So that perhaps is characteristic [unclear] the administration and my relationship with the state board.  Then as I went back into the state department, I had a different relationship, because I was assistant state superintendent from ’47 to ’48.

Bury:  Under Clements [phonetic].

Harkins:  Clements [unclear].  Clem was not a detail man.  He didn’t want anything to do with anything except floating around, dreaming, and talking to the governor and visiting with the farmers.  He had a lot of friends in the farm management [unclear].

Bury:  He was an agriculturist?

Harkins:  An agriculturist.  That was his [unclear] interest-that and vocational education.  He let me handle the academic [unclear] elementary and secondary.  The philosophy of being elected, having a board that was appointed, was, I think, and still is, something that’s very important.  I’m reminded of what Lyndon Johnson said [unclear] somebody talked about [unclear] statesman.  He said the best and quickest way to be a statesman is to have an election certificate.  If you just put "appointed" on it, you’re not going to be much of a statesman.  I think that’s what he was inferring.  Anyway, he was great [unclear] elected to something. Well, shall I go on from [unclear]?

Bury:  Yeah, we’ve got you up to about 1940.  Hendricks is finishing office, and the war’s coming.  Where do we find you, what are you doing?

Harkins:  Of course you know how I left the state board-I guess maybe somebody’s told you.  But when Osborn was elected governor, he demanded the resignation of every appointed official in the state.

Bury:  And this would include the state....

Harkins:  So I resigned.  [unclear]

Bury:  Why did Osborn want this, and did he have a right to do that with the board?

Harkins:  Yes, we all serve at the governor’s pleasure.

Bury:  On a board, though, once you’re appointed with the advice and consent of the senate, a governor could remove....

Harkins:  We didn’t have to be approved by the senate.

Bury:  But now the board, once appointed....

Harkins:  It does now.

Bury:  Right.  But back then, he could remove you, a governor could remove you?

Harkins:  Well, we represented Governor Bob Jones.  When Jones was defeated, Osborn was elected.  He wanted his own people.

Bury:  But this was still a Democratic governor?

Harkins:  Right.  But he wanted his own people.  So I submitted my resignation.  Anyway, in January 1941 I resigned and became principal of the Greenway [phonetic] Elementary School in <Bisbee>.  [unclear] took my place on the first day of February 1942.

Bury:  Now who did?

Harkins:  Lynette Pam [phonetic].  She was a schoolteacher in [summer?] [unclear] to help [unclear] <Texas>.  She’d been a teacher in [Greenway?] School for about fifteen or twenty years.  She took over my place on the first of February 1942 and served for about twenty years.  I think she retired in the sixties.  I know she retired in the middle sixties [unclear].  I went to <Bisbee> to Greenway Elementary School in January of ’41.  It’s part of the Bisbee school system, and the superintendent there was a personal friend of mine, Chuck Hall [phonetic].  I stayed there until December of ’42, and went in the navy.  Came to Phoenix teachers convention fall of ’42, and had dinner as a guest of [unclear] and West at Green Gables, with a whole bunch of school men.  The navy commander was there that was in charge of the recruiting office in <Phoenix> for the navy, and he asked if I’d like to have a commission in the navy, and I said, "I would certainly consider it."  "Well, come see me in the morning."  And before I went back to <Bisbee>, I had applied for a commission in the United States Naval Reserve.  My college roommate in <Flagstaff> was Bruce Harver [phonetic].  He was also the best man at my wedding, and my first child was named after him-Bruce.  [unclear]  Died in 1938 [unclear] appendix.  I lost two children in one year, one in ’37 and one in ’38.

Bury:  My gosh.

Harkins:  Bruce Harver graduated from Flag in 1932, he joined the naval reserve [unclear] ROTC program.  [unclear] <Florida> and became a pilot, and was killed during the war, but before he was killed he made a fantastic record.  He got three navy crosses-the third one posthumously.

Bury:  Now this was out in the Pacific?

Harkins:  Yeah.  [unclear] state park.

Bury:  We’ve got you ready to go in the navy.

Harkins:  Well, I spent three years in the navy.  I was commissioned in December of ’42, and went to Princeton University for officer indoctrination in January of ’43, and from there was ordered to Columbia University to study the navy college training program, V 12.  I went to Columbia for a couple of months in ’43 and took naval history, naval orientation and administration in the V-12 program, and was ordered to Kansas State Teachers College, <Pittsburgh Kansas>, from May of ’43 to open a V-12 school.  So I did, and was the officer in charge, and then got another officer, and I became the executive officer.  Taught naval history, naval orientation to 250 seamen first-class, some from the fleet and some right out of high school.  And in ’43 we converted a girls’ dormitory to a men’s dormitory, and we trained these boys to be [unclear] reserve ensigns.  Had a wonderful six months there, and had an undefeated football team.  I was the athletic officer for the football team in the fall of ’43.  I had some all-Americans from all around the country, kind of like the Iowa Seahawks, [unclear] Iowa State.  We’d meet everybody in the Midwest.  Couldn’t get the pre-flight school from Iowa or Notre Dame, either one, to play us, but we had an undefeated football team in the fall of ’43.  Made a lot of wonderful friends there, and Dr. Reese Hughes [phonetic], the president of the college, was more than nice to us.  My son was born there, Ronny [phonetic], who was later a student at [NAU?].

Bury:  What was his name?

Harkins:  Ronald.  He lives in <Prescott>.  He works for a construction company in <Prescott>.  He was born there [i.e., <Kansas>].  I decided that I didn’t want to be in the navy in the middle of <Kansas>, so I applied for sea duty for my last commission.  In two short weeks I had orders to the amphibious warfare school at Solomon’s Island Maryland.  I went there and took another refresher course for a couple of months, and was ordered to the [Fort Daw?] Shipyard in <Boston Massachusetts>.  I was executive officer of an LST.  So the nucleus of our crew was assigned there.  I got a commanding officer and I was the executive officer, and I picked up five young ensigns as my officer crew and the lead man in each of the areas of the ship operation.  We went to train for two months on Chesapeake Bay in LST’s, landing ships.  <Boston>, in the early spring of ’44, and put the LST-1006 into commission, and took off from <Norfolk Virginia>, to load to make the Normandy invasion.  Ran into a spike down there and they couldn’t get the ship loaded and painted properly at the time, so they suddenly switched our camouflage and switched our load, and we went heading to the Pacific.  Went down through the Panama Canal.  Out of Panama Canal, 700 miles off the Mexican coast between <Panama> and <San Diego>, we had a fire aboard ship.  I remember it very well because we fought fire all night.  It happened to be the day Eisenhower landed on [unclear], sixth day of June 1944.  We got the fire out and saved the ship, and went on to <San Diego> for repairs.  From there we went to <Pearl Harbor>.  We got there right after the big explosion of the ammunition depot out in the west lock of <Pearl Harbor>, which did more damage and killed more men than the Jap invasion of <Pearl Harbor>.  Not very much was said about it in the country at that time.  But anyway, that delayed our trip to the far western Pacific, and we had to destroy a lot of tanks and amphibious trucks, so we had to make a rush trip back to <San Francisco> and get a load of amphibious trucks and tanks for the invasion of <Saipan>.  Then things were changing rapidly in the Pacific, so we were switched to an invasion down in the Marshall Islands.  Before we could get down there, Halsey had made so much progress in destroying the Japanese Air Force, they switched us to the <Philippines>.  So we staged at Vilandia <New Guinea>, and with the 7th Fleet we moved into the <Philippines> on the twenty-fourth? of October 1944.  An LST was the first ship on the beach for the invasion of the <Philippines> at [Gulag?].  We stayed in the <Philippines> then until the war was over, and made seven different assault landings in the <Philippines> and [unclear].  We were in Subic Bay in the <Philippines>, preparing for the invasion of Kamishu [phonetic] Island, when the war ended.  We, of course, were a part of the giant celebration, and we exploded all of our pyrotechnics and made the sky look like day for hours, expending all of our surplus pyrotechnics in celebrating-about the only way we could celebrate the ending of the war.  We weren’t lucky like the sailors that were in <San Francisco> and <New York> at the time. I came home in November, arrived early December in <Phoenix>, 1945.  But after the war we hauled disarmed Japanese troops from <Korea> and <China> back to <Japan>.  We made several trips between <Korea> and <China> to <Japan>, hauling disarmed Jap troops.  I came home and went back to my position in <Mesa> and <Bisbee>.  I was principal of the elementary school, Greenway.  In the spring of ’46, a position came open in <Arizona> as a field representative for the U.S. Office of Education.  Ed Rave [phonetic] recommended me to the commissioner of education, [unclear].  I was appointed field representative for <Arizona> and <New Mexico> on the thirteenth day of April 1946.

Bury:  What do you remember of Ed Rave?  I have so little on him.

Harkins:  A great deal.  Ed Rave was a very good friend of mine and was a very fine state superintendent-an old <Arkansas> rural schoolteacher in <Maricopa County> for many years, had a very long administration as the county school superintendent.  He was responsible for my being appointed to the state board of education in the late thirties.  And I helped him become elected to state superintendent.  When he retired, just before he retired, he helped [unclear] education.

Bury:  Do you remember anything about his administration at that time?  I know you were gone most of the time during the war, but....

Harkins:  No, I don’t.  I don’t know any of the details, except that I think he was faced with all of the same problems that all of the other public officials were, shortage of help, shortage of teachers, shortage of materials.  Things were just sort of at a standstill, but he was quite active in working in the area of vocational training, skill training.  These defense plants, and helping to get the right kind of help.  I don’t know whether he held any particular positions in the war planning effort or not, but he at least kept the home fires burning, and I think did about as much as anybody could have done at the state level for education under the circumstances.

Bury:  Do you remember Mike Hurley?

Harkins:  Oh yes, very well.  Mike worked for me after I became state superintendent.

Bury:  He quit [unclear] over a difference of certification.

Harkins:  Right.

Bury:  I wonder if you know anything about it.

Harkins:  Well, not that I can relate.  Mike lost a lot of status, I think, over his differences with Ed, and was out of a job for several years.  I put him back in the state department in the certification department, helping Fred Miller [phonetic], who was the director of certification.  J. Fred Miller was [unclear] person in the state office of education and served in my administration and served in Brooks’ administration.  I think he served with Skipper Dick.  He might have quit before Skipper Dick’s time, but he went out to <Glendale> as the director of curriculum out there, [unclear] high school [unclear].

Harkins:  When you say <Glendale>, you might think of something.  To go back real quick to Hendricks, was Hendricks and Arrowsmith at <Glendale> in that group, really did they dictate Arizona education as some people accuse them of?

Harkins:  Pretty largely, yes.  And they ran the Arizona Education Association for years-you know, the administrators did.  And I was present in the AEA convention the day the teachers took over from the administrators.  Of course being an administrator, why....

Bury:  When was this?

Harkins:  This was in 1939, ’40.  Might have been ’41.  I was [unclear] down at <Yuma>.  All of us went from <Yuma>, all the administrators, [unclear] and so forth, went to <Tucson>.  We tried to elect Curly Mouse [phonetic] as the president of AEA.  The teachers beat us.  Ever since, teachers have elected the officers of the AEA.

Bury:  Now they’ve split off, and you have ADA for the administrators pretty much.

Harkins:  Yeah, the administrators have their own association.  Some significance should be attached [unclear] late forties to the school board association.  I helped organize the Arizona School Board Association.

Bury:  I’m familiar with that.  I’ve gotten some material [unclear] magazines.

Harkins:  In fact, while I was assistant state superintendent, we had a program to reorganize the state department of education.  I got the ADA to send Fred Beech [phonetic] out here from the U.S. Office of Education.

Bury:  Uh-huh, this would be during Clements?

Harkins:  Right.  I got the ADA to put in $1,500 to publish a report that [unclear] reorganization of the state department of education.

Bury:  What was in there?

Harkins:  I’ve got a copy of it.  You haven’t run onto a copy of it?

Bury:  No.  I’d be interested in it.  Did they make any specific recommendations as far as the superintendent’s position?

Harkins:  Yeah.  We were gonna [unclear] reorganize it and have an elected board and an appointed superintendent.

Bury:  Ah-ha, there we go again, yes.

Harkins:  In fact, we even wrote the constitutional amendment.  I’ve still got the original draft of the constitutional amendment, put that into effect.

Bury:  What reaction [unclear].

Harkins:  Well, that’s a story within itself.  Before we get to that, I think we ought to finish this U.S. office deal, because in 1946, from April ’46 until November of ’47, [unclear] probably October ’47, I worked stripping all of the military reservations as they became surplus in <Arizona>, giving the property rights to schools.  In fact, I built Bagdad School District out of surplus property, with Lon Adams’ [phonetic] help.  And did the same thing then in <Marana>-the old gym [unclear] <Marana> to <Tucson>, the old gym that you could see over there.  Ron Adams and I put it there in 1947 [unclear] Marana Army Air Base.  We moved a great big barracks from Marana Army Air Base to <Bagdad>, before we ever went to <Marana>, and put it-he wasn’t at <Marana> when I put that gym there.  Lauren Curtis [phonetic] was there.  Ron Adams was in <Bagdad> when I moved the big barracks up there and built the auditorium in <Bagdad>.  I later went up and made the speech and graduation address in 1955 when I was state superintendent, in that building.  But in those two years, I kind of had [unclear] report to the U.S. office for several hundred million dollars’ worth of property that I [unclear] <California>, all over the West.  I wrote the project proposal for the [unclear] Field Number One, the American Institute for Foreign Trade.  I’ve still got the letter that [unclear] Studebaker wrote to-I mean, the letter that General Barton [unclear] out the first president and founder of the school wrote to John W. Studebaker, commending me on my work getting that thing started.  I still have the copy of the letter that Martin [Lutz?] sent to John Studebaker. Well anyway, I did that for those two years, and then in ’47 Nolan Pulliam [phonetic] resigned, right after he was elected state superintendent, on the thirteenth of September.  And the old dean, Dean Wyman [phonetic], who had been his assistant, formerly the dean of Phoenix College, when Pulliam resigned and went to the U.S. office, Wyman resigned and went to the state department.  [unclear] Clements and myself and I don’t know who else were the candidates for the position of state superintendent.  And Osborn, although he was on his deathbed almost, [unclear].  He called me into the office-my office as field representative of the office of education, was in the senate appropriations committee room, except when the legislature was in session.  Then I went in Wes Bollings’ [phonetic] office, because the State hadn’t provided me an office.  So he called me in his office and could barely talk, but he said, "Cliff, [unclear] appoint Clements to that job."  I said, "Well, Governor, I think you made a mistake.  Clements is not an academician, he’s an agriculturist.  [unclear]."  Well he said [unclear].  Anyway, Nolan Pulliam went to Washington, and Wyman went to the state department, so Clements was appointed superintendent, and the U.S. office transferred me to <Los Angeles>.  I refused to go, and so I resigned.  When I resigned, Clements asked me to come and be his assistant [unclear].  And I was assistant state superintendent and the surplus property agent, because I had been running the surplus property division, and the State had just passed a law creating this new department of surplus property.  So he made me the surplus property agent, as well as assistant state superintendent.  So I was from September, October of ’47 until about the same time in ’48, for a year I was assistant [unclear]. During that year I had some very interesting experiences, one of which I visited the school at Short Creek and actually closed the school and suspended the teacher.  He didn’t have a certificate and was teaching without a certificate-wasn’t good.  He had an old certificate.  He had also married one of the eighth-grade girls.  Everybody in town was eating off the school lunch program.  They’d all come down to the school to the school lunch program.

Bury:  Where was Short Creek?  I remember this from being a kid, but where was it?

Harkins:  In the Arizona Strip.

Bury:  It’s in the Strip, I know.  How close to <Fredonia>?

Harkins:  It’s quite a long ways from <Fredonia>, but it’s not very far from....  Oh, what’s that city in <Utah>?

Bury:  <Kanab>?

Harkins:  <Kanab>.  Just south of <Kanab>, about 25 or 30 miles south of <Kanab>.  It’s only two or three miles from the <Utah> border.  Beautiful location, great huge cliffs there in the background.  They don’t call it Short Creek anymore, it’s got some other name-Arizona City or something.  Anyway, I suspended the teacher and cancelled his certificate and reported to the state board.  They had to get another teacher [unclear].

Bury:  Now, you were authorized to do this, right?

Harkins:  I would have just did it anyway, because he opened school with a prayer, he didn’t have any pledge of allegiance to the flag, and his certificate wasn’t any good.  He was a justice of the peace, too.  He was acting justice of the peace.

Bury:  Was there also this issue of multiple marriages involved in this [unclear]?

Harkins:  I was told he was a participant in that, because it was after this that [unclear] closed the place up, raided [unclear].  But he was married and he had married an eighth-grade girl, so somebody committed adultery.  Anyway, that experience, and then the one in <Holbrook>, where....

Bury:  Right, this is what I talked to you about.  <McNary>?

Harkins:  <McNary>.  I was sent to <McNary> to abolish segregation.

Bury:  Clements [phonetic] really hit the newspapers with that.

Harkins:  Have you got the clipping?

Bury:  Yeah.

Harkins:  My name mentioned in it?

Bury:  Oh yeah-if I can find it.  I’ve got all your clippings here that I could find.

Harkins:  I know Benton Snoddy told....

Bury:  Oh, I know, it’s in Clement’s file, which I don’t have with me.  These are just your articles.

Harkins:  Snotty told the deputy sheriff, "The next time Harkins comes to town, put him in jail and throw the key away."

Bury:  Now, who was this that said that?

Harkins:  Benton Snoddy, the town manager.

Bury:  Is he the fellow that was with Southwest Lumber?

Harkins:  Yeah.  He’s also the one that was with that Northern Arizona Bank now.  I think his office is in <Show Low> at the present time.  <McNary> was a one-man town.

Bury:  Right.

Harkins:  [unclear] town.

Bury:  What was the issue with the black students?

Harkins:  They wouldn’t let the kids go to school-they wouldn’t let 'em go to the high school.

Bury:  And there were what, four of them there?

Harkins:  I don’t remember how many, but they were down there at that little ol’ shack with the elementary kids.  I told 'em to let 'em go to high school with the white kids.

Bury:  Was this a black elementary school?

Harkins:  Yeah.

Bury:  And the high school students had to go there, if they were [unclear].

Harkins:  Right.  Right.

Bury:  Clements said that you said that the father of these kids was a teacher or principal there, or something like that.  Do you remember that?

Harkins:  One of the teachers was the father of some of the kids-I don’t know whether he was the principal or a teacher.

Bury:  Now this person that worked for Southwest, that was the town manager-you just mentioned his name.

Harkins:  Snoddy.

Bury:  How do you spell that?

Harkins:  S-N-O-D-D-Y.

Bury:  Yeah, that’s the same guy that’s in the newspaper article.  Okay.  And he was on the school board, right?

Harkins:  Right.

Bury:  And he was the one that kept the kids out of the school?

Harkins:  [unclear]

Bury:  Now at this time there was still legal segregation in the state.  However, if they had twenty-five or more black students, then they would have had a black high school.  But if it was less than that, they had to put 'em in the white school?

Harkins:  Right.

Bury:  And this gets me to the point:  Clements spoke out about this, but he did not speak out about the segregation law.  I was wondering about this myself.  He seemed to take issue only with the fact that they weren’t following the law as it was, but he didn’t speak out against the law.  Was he against the segregation, or was he against just the fact that this guy, McNary [i.e., Snoddy?], was....

Harkins:  No, Clements was a very liberal kind of man.  I’m sure he was not in favor of segregation, because the high school board had already abolished segregation here, you know.

Bury:  Right, in <Phoenix>.

Harkins:  In <Phoenix>.  Even though they had the old high school here in <Phoenix>-Carver High School-they had abolished segregation as such.  In fact, they abolished segregation long before the Supreme Court decision [unclear].

Bury:  Do you remember when, here in town, because....

Harkins:  About ’48, I think, about that same time.  Segregation is still in existence in <Arizona>, particularly in <Glendale> and <Miami> both-they have Mexican schools.  It’s a common practice.  Douglas.  But I started to fight against segregation in <Yuma>, because I hired the first colored person in the state department of education.  I have a picture of that.  I got colored kids to go to the white school in <Yuma>.

Bury:  Now this was when you were county superintendent?

Harkins:  Right.

Bury:  And you say now you hired a colored person when you were state superintendent?

Harkins:  First colored person to work in the state department of education was hired by my administration.  I’ve got a picture of her.

Bury:  What did she do?

Harkins:  Worked in the textbook department, I believe [unclear].  I’ve got a scrapbook of my state superintendency you might want to [unclear].

Bury:  What else happened during Clements’ time, and what can you tell me about Clements himself?

Harkins:  Clements and his wife had separated.  They had a little place in <Prescott>, out Senator Highway.  You know that little [unclear].  He was a dreamer.  He was a big, lazy man, he wouldn’t campaign.  He couldn’t walk up to somebody and stick his hand out and say, "I’m L. D. Clements, state superintendent.  I’d like to have your vote."  He just couldn’t do that.  He was a real expert in agricultural education.

Bury:  Did he have any public school administration that you know of-or I mean experience in public schools teaching?

Harkins:  Well, he taught down to the university in [unclear].

Bury:  This would be at the university level?

Harkins:  I don’t know of any public school experience that he had.  He might have had in his early days, but I don’t know that.  But he could come up with some fantastic ideas, but he never could implement them, because he just didn’t follow through on things.  He predicted all of this growth, and we would go to the prison [unclear], or drive around the state during the campaign.  He predicted just exactly what happened in <Arizona> as far as growth was concerned.  And he predicted this multiple housing business.  He was in on the development of these standardized kitchens [unclear] homemaking and things we use [unclear].  When you build a house today, you know, you’ve got a built-in [unclear].  I remember him drawing plans and working on things, years and years before they became standardized [unclear].  [unclear] one day down to <Florence>.  We went through <Apache Junction> and he said, [unclear].  And they are!  Those are there today!  He was involved in the Farm Management Association.  It’s a big outfit here in the state.  He spent [unclear] worrying about agricultural affairs [unclear].  And he’d go to make a speech, and everybody would....  He’d babble on, and they’d always accuse him of gettin’ off on a rabbit trail.  But he was a very interesting character, and was [unclear] fall of ’48.  [unclear]

Bury:  In a short time he didn’t hesitate to take on the legislature, and he did it in the newspapers, which is sort of a first for the office.

Harkins:  He raised hell with them.

Bury:  Was he justified?  He said you quit because of him.

Harkins:  I didn’t quit!  I quit because he got defeated.

Bury:  He said that you quit because [unclear].  And this is after he’d been defeated.  He said it in the Arizona Republic, "My man Cliff Harkin don’t work anymore because you guys won’t pay him.  I can’t afford a decent assistant."

Harkins:  Well, that’s right.  I think I was making $7,200 when I refused to be transferred to <Los Angeles>, U.S. Office of Education, in ’47.  When I went back to work for him, I went to work for about $5,500, I think.  I took a big salary cut.

Bury:  He went to the legislature twice that year-twice in one year-asking for an extra [procurement?], exceptional money.  He said he needed it for textbooks, and needed it for the loyalty oath, needed it to pay you.  He said the department simply couldn’t be run the way it was, that there wasn’t any staff.  Was this true?  Were you really understaffed?  Were there things you needed to do?

Harkins:  Apparently.  We had about four or five professional people [unclear] 475.

Bury:  Six hundred.

Harkins:  Four hundred seventy-five last time I counted.

Bury:  Six hundred now, I hear, just about.

Harkins:  When I left the office, I had seventy-five people-I think eighty-five counting [unclear].

Bury:  Where was the office during Clements’ [administration]-in the capitol?

Harkins:  Right next to the governor’s office.

Bury:  They hadn’t moved it into the apartments yet, or anything like that?

Harkins:  No, it was right next to the governor’s office.  Mine was too, when I was there.  In fact, they didn’t change it until Skipper Dick moved out of the second floor [unclear] first floor.

Bury:  How did Clements get along with the new governor?

Harkins:  Apparently he got along with Dan Garvey alright.  I don’t remember any problems after [unclear].  He had been elected, so I never paid too much attention to him.  The small counties ran the legislature in those days-had two senators from each county [unclear] representatives [unclear].  The Democrats were controlled by the [unclear] mines.  That’s one thing I wanted to ask you [unclear] 1966.

Bury:  Right.  How much effect did the [Moites?]-they say that the Moites owned Arizona [unclear] 1950s [in England?].  How much did they have an effect directly on education, superintendent’s office, and school districts?

Harkins:  Well, they had lots of effect because they controlled the money.  They said they wouldn’t let us have enough help, wouldn’t let us have enough money.

Bury:  You mean they controlled the legislature?

Harkins:  Oh right.  They didn’t control the [unclear], they controlled the districts in their own communities-lock, stock, and barrel.  In <Bisbee>, for example, Jeb Hollow [phonetic] was superintendent, and when he was hired as superintendent, he knew he had come up through the ranks.  I was employed in <Bisbee> at the elementary school, to be principal of Greenway School, to go from there to the high school as high school principal, to go from there to the superintendent.  By the time I became superintendent, I was completely aware of how the mines operated, how they controlled everything, and they had to keep people on the board.  When it came time to budget, the board members told the superintendent....  The superintendent was already aware of how it worked, because that’s the way they brought you up.  They didn’t go and bring in an outsider to be superintendent.

Bury:  Did they support their own school districts pretty well?

Harkins:  Very well.  The schoolteachers there were happy, until after World War II.

Bury:  What happened then?

Harkins:  Well, the teachers [went] out in the world, found out how things are done [other places?], and brought in a few rebels that got 'em stirred up, and the education association became more militant, so they had more to say, and the influence of the association became stronger.  It was just a different world for everybody after World War II.
