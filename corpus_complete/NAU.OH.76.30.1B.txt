C. L. Harkins- Part 2

Interviewed by John Bury

November 16, 1974



Bury:  Yesterday Gene Morris [phonetic] was saying that during the Depression, when he was working with Hendricks, [unclear] the problems, like with teachers, your pay, your warrants at this time, the fact that education had to take really a couple steps backward.  You know, we had kindergarten education before the Depression.

Harkins:  Oh yeah.  Sure.

Bury:  And all these things were cut off.  He said it was because of the mines, that the State could have paid for this during the Depression, but the mines were determined to hold the level that they’d obtained.

Harkins:  [unclear] and still galls 'em because they have to give in to statewide support [unclear].

Bury:  We have a history professor up there, Jim Byrkit, whose dad was superintendent of Jerome for the mine.  Jim just got his Ph.D. with a dissertation on the mines.  And he says just what we’re saying here, but he takes about a thousand pages to show how the mines ran <Arizona>.  It’s all documented.  People want to publish it, and every time somebody wants to publish it, [unclear].  They thought with Douglas dying, things would be a little better, but it’s still not.

Harkins:  What’s his name?  Byrkit?

Bury:  Yeah, Jim Byrkit, B-Y-R-K-I-T.  His dad was superintendent at Clarkdale-not Jerome.  He’d written this, and they’re gonna see if they can even make a movie out of it.

Harkins:  I made a speech at the text conference when I was state superintendent in 1955.  I think that’s probably the first and only time in the history of <Arizona> that a superintendent of public instruction has spoken at a text conference.  The county [unclear].  I [unclear] financial support of the school system in <Arizona> [unclear] money where it is, and use it where it’s needed.  I got headlines in the papers [unclear] my comments.

Bury:  Do you think the....

Harkins:  Phelps-Dodge.  I also got the state aid increased $27.40 [unclear] Phelps-Dodge people said then that they just didn’t want anybody running things unless they could [unclear].

Bury:  Were the other corporate entities this way?  I’ve seen in my historical study they couldn’t get the railroads to pay for the county education for a couple of years.  Did you have any problems [unclear]?

Harkins:  [unclear]  They wanted to keep it an unorganized territory.  [unclear] organized territory [unclear].

Bury:  [unclear]

Harkins:  [unclear] railroad to Santa Fe and El Paso Natural Gas.  [unclear] El Paso Gas Company.  In fact, one instance when I was county superintendent I didn’t tell you about in <Yuma County>, [Dallas?] had a one-room school, and they had an old building that’d been built there in the early 1900s-before 1900, I guess.  Potbellied stove in the middle of the room.  Kind of got the school board to agree to build a new school.  They had a long line with Santa Fe Railroad.

Bury:  Where was this?

Harkins:  In <Bouse>, in <Yuma County>.

Bury:  How do you spell that?

Harkins:  B-O-U-S-E.  It’s halfway between <Salome> and <Parker>.

Bury:  Oh yeah.  Okay, I know where it is.

Harkins:  It was a big mining community at one time.  It was the entrance to Swanzee [phonetic], over on the Bill Williams River.  Swanzee was a big mining town from the early days.  Anyway, I advertised for a bond election for about, I don’t know, ten or fifteen thousand dollars, something like that, in 1940-41, to build a new school in <Bouse>, and Santa Fe Railroad sent me a telegram, said, "You call off your bond issue and we’ll build you a school."  I said, "You send me a check for the school for the amount of the bonds, and I’ll call off the bond election."  And so they did.  I built the school, they gave us a check for the money.  I think it was $7,500, and I build the two-room school that’s there today, with that Santa Fe Railroad money.  They didn’t [unclear].

Bury:  Yeah, they [unclear].

Harkins:  [unclear] taxpayer [unclear].  That’s the best example of control that I [unclear].

Bury:  That’s a good one.  It’s amazing how many problems, I know talking to [unclear].  Of course Sarah Folsom went through this in <Yavapai County> [unclear].  Did you have any other problems in the area of unorganized territory, or the corporations while you were working with Clements or during this period, trying to get money for education?

Harkins:  Well, one thing we did, we set up the accommodation school out at Williams Field.  It’s still there.

Bury:  Now you call this an accommodation school?

Harkins:  Right.  It’s a school created to accommodate an emergency.  And anywhere there was not an organized school, and it was run by the county school superintendent, and run by the county reserve fund.  Every county set up a county school reserve fund to take care of schools in unorganized territory.  The county superintendent administered that fund.  It was a source of a lot of problems for school people and boards of supervisors because there was no school board.  School superintendent was the board.  He, I, and the chairman of the board of supervisors both signed the checks.  We paid the teachers, we paid all the expenses, we bought the school buses, or we provided the transportation or whatever to unorganized territory.  There’s always a fight and a big discussion every year at the county school superintendents’ convention-when I was a county superintendent, when I was assistant superintendent, when I was state superintendent-how to operate the reserve fund and what it could be spent for.  [unclear] hundred attorney general’s [unclear] the use of the county reserve fund to provide educational services in unorganized territory.  And the big interests wanted to keep as much territory as possible unorganized so there wouldn’t be any tax on it.

Bury:  Couldn’t assess it.  Do you think Clements was justified in attacking Lloyd Henning, who was chairman of the appropriations committee?

Harkins:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.

Bury:  Lloyd Henning [unclear] Clements [unclear] run for office.

Harkins:  Yeah.  Well, Lloyd Henning was a brilliant man, but he was stubborn and one-minded about a lot of things.  I ran into his daughter-in-law the other day [unclear].  He was really a brilliant man.  He was unscrupulous when he wanted to get his way about something.  [unclear] telephone service.

Bury:  Is there anything else you remember that you were involved in during the Clements period, as assistant superintendent?

Harkins:  Well, let’s see....  We had a-I think it was [unclear] Holbrook on the handling of school funds in Holbrook-the building of the school and the way the school boards were involving conflicts of interest.  The county superintendent spent a lot of money, and it wasn’t legal.  The county treasurer paid the checks and there wasn’t any money.  He never registered the warrants.  There were some prominent people involved in that, that are still active in public affairs in <Arizona> today.  I can’t remember all the details.  [unclear] in the book, because I’m not sure of the facts.  But I remember that one of the ladies that’s on the state board or state advisory committee, state department today, whose family was [unclear].  But the big thing that happened with Hendricks was when Clements [unclear] was our effort to reorganize the state department.  And the fact that the AEA underwrote this survey, and we got the constitution where we were just in the throes of getting the constitutional amendment put on the ballot, when Rosie Rosenbaum died.  I had the thing through the house-I submitted it through the house-and it was about to go through the senate, and it went to the judiciary committee.  Francis Reilly, a prominent Phoenix attorney, is [unclear] college roommate, and they were at the University of Arizona, got together.  And this guy, he’s a prominent cattleman from Prescott-I can’t think of his name.  He was chairman of the judiciary committee.  He kept that bill from getting out of committee.  I think at that time if it had gotten out of committee and been passed and put on the ballot, we’d have got the thing passed, we’d have got the constitution changed that year.

Bury:  Now what was in this?  You say that there was a provision for an elective board, to appoint a superintendent.  Just the opposite.

Harkins:  Right.  We were gonna elect the state board of education, a nine-man board-I believe it was nine-no more than two members from any one county.  They were to be elected at the time the school trustees were to be elected.  They would make up the state board of education, and they would select the superintendent.

Bury:  Did you mention in this law any requirements for the superintendents, since there hadn’t been?  What were the requirements as you remember them?

Harkins:  The state board was authorized to select the superintendent, establish his qualifications, set his salary and his term of office.

Bury:  So everything was up to the state board then, they would determine all of this, whatever qualifications.  Was this new superintendent to have any more power than he had before, or was he still going to be the administrative officer of the board, and operate at their....

Harkins:  In the constitutional amendment we didn’t say anything about his power [unclear].  The state board was to establish his power.

Bury:  So actually then they would have the power.

Harkins:  [unclear] establish his power, determine his qualifications, set his salary, the whole thing.

Bury:  Do you think this would still be a good deal, would you recommend that now?

Harkins:  Well, I’m a great believer in involving people in the educational system.  And if you’re going to appoint the superintendent, I think you ought to elect the board.  If you’re gonna elect the superintendent, I think you ought to appoint the board.

Bury:  Can an elected superintendent work with an appointed board?  (no audible response)  If he represents the people, and he’s elected by the people as you were, and if you have a board that has a different philosophy than you have, what are you gonna do?  Do you follow [unclear]?

Harkins:  Well, I had problems with the board, but I believe if I were appointed for a term of office....  You know, if the state board is gonna [bunch it?] from year-to-year, it’d be worse than it is now.  But since there’s a four-year term for all other offices, they wouldn’t dare appoint you for less than four years.  I had two major battles with the governor.

Bury:  This is when you were superintendent?

Harkins:  Right.

Bury:  Let’s get you up to that point, and then you won’t have to go back.  You left Clements’ office in ’48?

Harkins:  In the fall of ’48, and I went to <California> as the representative of the John C. Watson Publishing Company, and I worked for them for about seven or eight months until July of ’49, when I was appointed superintendent of the Madison School District.

Bury:  Okay, and you served in that capacity as superintendent of Madison until you ran for the office of superintendent?

Harkins:  I served until December 31, 1954, until I took office.

Bury:  Until you took office, right.

Harkins:  Five-and-a-half years.  That’s the longest period of time I’ve spent in any one job in my forty-three-year career.  Five-and-a-half years.  I spent five years in nearly every job that I’ve ever had.

Bury:  That’s pretty good.  Madison #1 was considered a [unclear] pretty good job.

Harkins:  Top dollar [unclear].  Still is.  School board [unclear].  It has the best staff and the best philosophy, and I think actually the best educational program of any [unclear] in the state.  I know something about all of 'em.

Bury:  What about your running against Tim L. Brooks, before we get into your fight with the governors.

Harkins:  Well, do you want to talk about Madison any?

Bury:  Yeah, I would like to-whatever you have that would be significant during this time.

Harkins:  Well, I did some things at Madison that I think had statewide impact.  I had six or seven bond issues in five years.  They all passed but one.  I was able to settle the worst community school fight, I think in-one of the worst in the history of the state.

Bury:  What was this about, and when was this?

Harkins:  This was when I went there, in ’49.

Bury:  What was involved?

Harkins:  Over the primary program, primary [unclear].

Bury:  The curriculum in the primary grades?

Harkins:  Well, the level system.  They had a level system.  They had five levels in the first three grades, instead of grades.  And the gal running the primary department, primary supervisor, had kind of set herself off as a separate school, and defied the superintendent, the school board, and everybody else.  That’s the reason Cliff Condon [phonetic] quit and I took his place.

Bury:  Empire building.

Harkins:  So [there was a] big school board fight that fall, and I was able to put it back together by defeating the faction that had created most of the trouble in getting them back together.  Bud Brown and Dr. Condon and Dick Symus [phonetic] were the members of the board.

Bury:  I know all three of those [unclear].

Harkins:  Well, I was employed, and the election that fall, Bud Brown was up for re-election.  So just before the election, Dr. Condon resigned and John Berry put John Armor [phonetic] in his place.  And then Condon turned around and ran against Bud Brown.  So Armor and Condon could have gotten control [unclear].  Well, I saw what was happening in the community and the people that were supporting the school.  We got the [unclear] teachers to collaborate, and Bud Brown was clobbered.  [unclear]  So then it became still Bud Brown, John [unclear] and Dick Symus.  So those three guys had a men’s club meeting, and the house was full.  We had a little board meeting first, and I got the board to agree that anybody that wanted to speak had to put their questions in writing for the board.  And so we kind of slowed things down, and then I got the board to adopt a set of written policies that they’d never had before.  Anybody that wanted to bring up a subject, it had to be presented to the board before in writing.  Got the school put back together, and then the bond issues came thick and fast to keep up with the growth, so I got an advisory committee.  And I got Arch Allenburg [phonetic] to be chairman of the advisory committee, and we had the first advisory committee active job done, in the survey of a school district in the state.  And the advisory committee and the policies of the school board were two things that became models all over the state.  I lectured at the colleges, and it’s still used by administrators in the state that we did at the Madison School [unclear].  Of course that plus the [unclear] my work on school buildings, and I had the model classroom built out there in the number one [unclear], that corner room, and all that stuff.  I still have the picture of that group that was there.  [Ron Adams?] was [killed?] [unclear].  Chet Hall [phonetic] from <Bisbee>, and all my old buddies.  Since Madison was the leader, and I had been a young county superintendent, and went on the state board, and had made some splashes, and I had a good war record, I gave all of these schools surplus property after the war.  I had the statewide reputation, so that’s what made me decide to run for state superintendent.  Of course I had been assistant superintendent [unclear] all the counties, [unclear] campaign with Clemson.  Do you know I’d have to get him out of bed to get him to come to the office, to go to campaign.  And I have been to his house at noontime, trying to get him out of bed.  He was the laziest guy I ever knew in the field of education.  And of course Lauren Vaughn [phonetic] was our director of research.  He was later superintendent of Phoenix Elementary, and died last year, a couple of years ago.  He was the same way.  Lauren never came-the office was open from nine to five-he never got there by nine o’clock.  I just, having been raised on the farm, I got up at four o’clock in the morning when I was a kid, and worked until after sundown.

Bury:  Yeah, it gets in your head.

Harkins:  Then being in the navy, you know, where I was [unclear] especially in a war zone.  I just couldn’t visualize people sleeping [unclear]-and still don’t!  I still don’t.  I was awake at 5:30 this morning, and ready to get up [unclear] back to sleep, up at seven.  I had to have [unclear] ten.  She got some sleep too.  She works hard and burns up a lot of energy in retirement-[unclear] more sleep than I do.

Bury:  And I know my wife’s one of those that gets up at five in the morning.  She was brought up on a farm, and she’s always ready to go.

Harkins:  When I became superintendent, I really was gonna change the world.  I had a big advisory committee working for me.  After the primary, we started working on our plans for the state department.  My wife was a secretary in the school district, and a secretary in my office.  I offered her a job in the state department and she went with me and became number one secretary, practically ran the office when I was away.

Bury:  What happened between you and Brooks?  I mean, you got a lot of newspaper coverage there when he wouldn’t let you in the office.  You took a Republic reporter along and....  What’s your side of that?

Harkins:  The story is that "Brooks Castrated Harkins."  (ha!)  [unclear] story said "Brooks Castigates Harkins."

Bury:  That’s right, that’s it.  I think it’s in here too.

Harkins:  Well, he was mad because I had sent a notice to some of his employees that I wasn’t going to keep them on staff.

Bury:  Now why did you decide to do that?

Harkins:  Well, for several reasons.  I didn’t feel that I could trust them.  Some of them where he had been connected with this [unclear] scandal, you know.  And his assistant, [unclear] Kaywood [phonetic] had gone to prison over it.  I never did feel that Brooks was qualified to be state superintendent.  He was a shop teacher in several schools around the state, but he wasn’t really considered by the educators as being qualified-although he did, I think, a reasonably good job as the state superintendent.  He played more politics than I did, and that’s the reason he was re-elected, and that’s the way he defeated me, by playing politics.  I didn’t do anything but work and try to accomplish some of my objectives.  It was customary to take your own staff into an office.  I didn’t see anything wrong with notifying these people what was coming around until I was authorized to do it.  [unclear]

Bury:  What happened when you guys went in and talked alone for a couple of hours there, and he left the reporter outside?  Brooks came out and said he gave it to you, and you came out and you said you gave it to Brooks.  What really happened in there?  Or did not much of anything really happen?

Harkins:  We were, I think, primed to make as smooth a transition as possible under the circumstances of some people losing their job and bringing some new people in.  I don’t remember any violent disagreement with Brooks, except he was mad because I had decided to let some of his people go.  I think it’s perfectly natural that he would have that sense of loyalty.  He didn’t see any reason why I couldn’t keep them [unclear].  I had some people who helped me get elected, and I know that they had worked very hard for the other person, so I think I was perfectly justified because I had a lot of goals, ideas, and things I wanted to do, and I thought I had to have my own people to do it.  That’s all I remember about it.  Wasn’t anything really personal about it.

Bury:  While you were running, and during the period right after your election, as you mentioned you had planned to do a lot of things.  You [unclear] the AEA and reported in the newspaper.  I have here your proposed program here, as of September 1, 1954, the eventual goal of eight districts, $180 for students; other aids to encourage more young people to entertain teaching; to continue to guarantee local control of state education.  You wrote a one eight "A" [18A] article using nautical terms about the "ship of education" and what you were gonna do with it.  In fact, here it is right here:  "First we much draw up a blueprint for education in <Arizona>.  We must chart our course," [unclear] teacher.  "We need to decide where we’re going; secure the best leadership available; and after the course is charted, then we must be willing to pay the cost of education."  Looked like you had some pretty idealized ambitions there.  What did you find out when you got into office?  Did you realize these, were you able to?  What was the reality of the office?

Harkins:  I think that....  And I have letters and telegrams in my files to justify this:  I think I did more in two years than any other state superintendent in the history of the state.

Bury:  Okay, why?  What did you do?

Harkins:  I know I did, because I conducted forty-seven little White House conferences.   Do you know about the White House Conference on Education?

Bury:  Yes.

Harkins:  I’ve got two copies of it here.  This is the national report.  And there is one of mine that I don’t have a copy of.  It’s in the Arizona section of the ASU Library, the one that I know of.  It’s a green book that summarizes the work of the White House Conference in <Arizona>.  I conducted forty-seven of these in every community in the state in 1955.  We discussed four or five major problems, and they were all centered around the need for more and better teachers, the need for more and better facilities, the need for more and better textbooks and materials, the need for more and better community leadership and participation.  I then went to the White House Conference in December of ’55, that Eisenhower called.  He wasn’t there, he was sick.  It’s when he had his first heart attack, I think.  But we focused the state’s attention on this, on these shortages.  I think that got the legislature to increase [unclear] ADA for the first time in a number of years.

Bury:  How much did they increase it to?

Harkins:  Twenty-seven fifty was the increase [unclear], from 25 to 157 [unclear].

Bury:  Did the corporations fight you on this one?

Harkins:  Oh yes, the legislature had a bitter fight on it.  There’s lots of material on the fight.  Made headlines in the paper, and held up the termination of the legislative session [unclear].  That was one of the major achievements of my administration:  that and this White House Conference.  And I’m [confirmative?] [unclear] that’s the reason I was beat, because I attended every board meeting of the board of regents.  I attended every meeting of the children’s [unclear]; every meeting of the deaf and the blind school; every meeting, except one, I believe, of the state board [of juveniles?]; every meeting of the board of pardons and paroles.  I even went down there for two executions, watched the executions, because I was instrumental in the action.  One of them, the attorney general refused to participate, it was so hot.  I had to make the decision.  He was the chairman, so I had to make the motion that this guy be executed, that would deny his parole.  I attended forty-seven of these.  I had a state meeting at the end.  And then we went to the national.  That’s all we did, almost, in 1955.  If you could look at these books that we put out, every one of 'em are dated 1956.  That’s the finest book on holidays ever published anywhere-at least the National Curriculum Commission thought so.  This, to me, indicates that you can’t accomplish much the first year.  But it took me months to get a staff.  After Lon Adams turned me down, I was months in getting Roy Doomer [phonetic].  I couldn’t get a director of secondary education because I was offering $5,500 and $6,000 and they were all making $8,000 and $10,000.

Bury:  How much were you getting paid to superintend?

Harkins:  Well, I got the salary raised to $9,600.  (both talking at same time, neither discernable).  I was getting about $7,000 or $8,000.

Bury:  Yeah, that was lower than average [unclear].

Harkins:  Seventy-two hundred [$7,200] or something like that.  I was making....

Bury:  Did you take a drop from Madison 1?

Harkins:  No, wait a minute.  I got $9,600 I think the year I left Madison.  I took a cut when I went from Madison to the state superintendency.  But the salary flipped to $9.600 the year I left, in ’56, [unclear].  So....

Bury:  Referring to the questionnaire here now, since we’ve got you in your superintendency, I want to get some specific things answered.  Of these things you’ve mentioned, what would be the most positive singular event that you are most proud of as superintendent, that you think was the most significant?  The White House Conference, the raise of ADA, what would be the one thing you think had the greatest effect, that you most directly were responsible for?

Harkins:  I think the White House Conference.

Bury:  Now what did you see come out of the White House Conference?  Did you see any hard-rock results in the state, maybe immediately after, also later after you’d left office?  Did you see any of the effects of the White House Conference, as far as educational change?

Harkins:  Well, I think the greatest single result was the focusing of the people’s attention onto the public school system and its needs, because we were short of everything after the war:  we were short of teachers; we were short of buildings and materials and facilities and supplies, curriculum materials, textbooks.  Through a lot of publicity, local newspapers, and through these community meetings with leaders not only from the state, but from the national level, we focused attention on the need of the schools.  That led to the legislative pressure to increase the ADA, that [interest?].

The other thing, another significant event, was the creation of the OAC, the real development of the Arizona School Board Association, got the trustees involved.  We got them involved more with the administrators.  I think they’ve been a viable force in education ever since.  They’ve had some wonderful leaders, like the one they have now, [unclear], and the fellow that started it-can’t remember his name-he was superintendent of Glendale Schools at the turn of the century.

Bury:  Was it Harold Smith?

Harkins:  No, uh-uh.  But he was superintendent before Harold Smith came [unclear].  Anyway, he was the first one, then they had the second guy who was crippled, and then [unclear] Heinz [phonetic] took his place.  The School Board Association helped the schools get attention from the public [unclear] and such. I got a lot of laws changed, too.  I had a tremendous program of changing the laws.  I had something to do with getting the home state code [unclear].

Bury:  I know you republished a new one.  In what areas specifically do you remember, as far as the superintendent’s office?  Do you remember any of this?

Harkins:  Oh, attendance, finances, administration, textbooks.  I worked very hard on multiple textbook options.  Didn’t get it passed until the next year, but that’s something [unclear].  Mostly I worked hard on the ten-cent levy, building bond issues, and so forth.

Bury:  What was the ten-cent levy?

Harkins:  Well, you know, the school board was authorized to spend to levy, tax, ten cents per $100 assessed valuation, and that could build up over the years.  It’s now up to thirty cents something-hoping to build a reserve of building funds [unclear].  A lot of technicalities of how this money could be used, and whether or not it could be used without the consent of the people.  Clause having to do with the qualifications, certification, of teachers; reserve fund.

Bury:  Were there any requirements, or was anything changed as far as certification at this time?

Harkins:  Oh yeah, [unclear] I’ve got some of the certification manuals right here [unclear] state archives.  I set up, I think, the first really effective advisory commission on certification of teachers.

Bury:  Who made up this commission?

Harkins:  Dr. Gillenwater was the leader of it for several years.  You could talk more about it with Virgil Gillenwater.

Bury:  In what areas were the certification requirements changed, if any?  I mean, in any major way?  Were they increased?

Harkins:  My work in changing things was done through the state board.  Because, you know, there was not very much said about the law.  The law says that the state board [unclear].

Bury:  [unclear]

Harkins:  [unclear] certification of teachers.  But I did more work with the state board on the certification and curriculum and school bonding and things of that nature, than I did anything else.  This, for example, was, I think, approved by the board in August of 1956.  Represented a year, year-and-a-half of work in curriculum.  This was done at the same time and represented work from people all over the state-at least a year, year-and-a-half-curriculum, done through the state board.  This was done in 1956.  It’s actually a teaching guide, teachers’ handbook in elementary education.  This was done in late ’56.  I got this done through the aid of the architects and builders of the state.  It’s an excellent guide.  Hymie Lean [phonetic] did most of the work on this.  He’s school building consultant for Ed Varney [phonetic] at the present time.  These other reports are pretty much standardized, but that’s the custodians’ handbook that I did in Madison School District.  This is one of the most important things that we did.  This is the high school study commission, and wasn’t completed until after I left office.  But the state board of education in the summer of 1956 authorized changing the qualifications for graduation from the Arizona high schools.  And it’s the first change that’s been made in years.  The state board authorized it in ’56.  It wasn’t finished until 1957.  Here are the people that were involved.  "ArizonaHigh School Study Commission to the state board of education, 1957.  A report on certain aspects of the philosophy of education, requirements for graduation, articulation programs, approaches to guidance in the high schools of <Arizona>."  This was copied almost exactly by, in the Life magazine, in 1957, ’58.  Do you remember....  What was the guy’s name?  The prominent Harvard educator that wrote all of these books?

Bury:  Dr. [James Bryant] Conant?

Harkins:  We called him Co-nant, I think.  He wrote the book called The Comprehensive High School.

Bury:  Right.

Harkins:  Well, that was done while I was in <South America>, because I read it in Life magazine, and it’s almost exactly what we have in here.  That was after [unclear].  Here’s "Philosophy of Education in Arizona High Schools" that was published June 1, 1957.  J. J. Jelanik [phonetic] [unclear] a lot of this.

Bury:  I [unclear] his name.  I sit on a board with him right now.  We’re both on the board of directors of an organization.  Gee, I enjoy that guy!  He’s really a wizard.

Harkins:  I was considered at one time one of the, I think, best-informed people in the state on school finance, and I wrote my doctoral dissertation on budget operation [unclear] secondary school.  But this is budget instructions for fiscal year ’58 and ’59, Phoenix Union High School System.  That’s the result of my work and my interest in the state department.  I was the budget officer.  This was published January 27, 1958.  I went directly from my office to the Phoenix Union High School district headquarters over on North Eleventh there, which was the old Phoenix College.

Bury:  You mentioned something that I don’t want us to lose here.  I cut you off earlier, and I don’t want to lose it.  You got in a few arguments with Governor McFarland.  What was that all about?

Harkins:  Well, for years, I guess since statehood, the University of Arizona had what we call high school visitors to help maintain standards in high school, since the North Central Association was started and became prominent in strengthening the standards for secondary schools.  And the state board of education always had somebody at the University of Arizona as high school visitor.  I had talked to Dr. Gammage about this for years, and he was interested in having a high school visitor represent all three of the colleges.  This was all early in my administration.  I recommended to the state board of education that the high school visitor be selected from Arizona State University, and that all the colleges have a chance to have that experience.  I didn’t [unclear] University of Arizona [unclear].  Well, Bill Austin[phonetic] was a graduate of the University of Arizona.  He was one of McFarland’s [unclear].  But [unclear] was county superintendent, [unclear].  Wes Townsend was the representative of the high school [counselors of the state?].  Of course the university president didn’t like the idea, so he got Bill Austin and Wes Townsend to go together.  I think Wes might have got his master’s from Tucson, and they went to McFarland and told him what [he] should be doing.  So I had a 5 to 4 vote:  I had Gammage, Harkins, [Pam?], and the other guy in <Flagstaff>.

Bury:  Eastwood [phonetic]?

Harkins:  Eastwood, uh-huh.  And they had McFarland, president of the university, and Austin, Townsend, and we must have had somebody absent.  Anyway, they outvoted us 4 to 3 [unclear].  Maybe Eastwood went with 'em.  Anyway, it was 5 to 3 [unclear] 4 to 3.  I lost that thing.  The other was that I attempted....  I had had such luck with my policy manual, policy handbook, in Madison.  And I had had used it in workshops at <Flagstaff> and ASU, that I felt the policies of the state board of education must be in writing.  I worked on the damned things for months.  Well, right after our first [unclear] battle [unclear] White House staffers.  I got to the state board and I proposed [unclear] McFarland [unclear] chairman [unclear].  And the guys went along with it, his appointees went along with it.

Bury:  Gee, that’s a shame.  That department needed that.

Harkins:  I think those two things were probably the two major defeats [unclear] as far as the [unclear] was concerned.

Bury:  So in spite of the fact you were both Democrats, you and McFarland still were not working together [unclear].

Harkins:  No, he was pretty good most of the time.  But he would just go along.  But just by a chance remark, or a comment, he could sway the [unclear].

Bury:  What do you think now?  You’ve got a board that’s all appointed by the governor.  And in fact, all nine of 'em have been appointed by Jack Williams.  And now you’ve got a Democrat, Carolyn Warner [phonetic] [unclear].  How is she gonna survive?

Harkins:  Gonna be rough.  She’ll have two new members in January-Kennedy and Walkup.  Walkup [unclear] most of the....

Bury:  Yeah, he’s been....

Harkins:  [unclear]

Bury:  He’s been the more liberal of the conservatives, right.

Harkins:  I think Slaughter [phonetic] will be....  I think it’s his turn.  They take turns [unclear].

Bury:  Yeah.

Harkins:  I think it’s Slaughter’s turn, and Slaughter’s a good man, and I think he’ll [unclear].  I don’t know who’ll take Kennedy’s place in Globe, but I’d like to serve on it myself.  I could help Carolyn a lot.  We’re good friends, and I’ve offered my help any way I can.  There are other things that I’d rather do.  Castro’s a personal friend of mine.  If I go after something, I’ll probably go after [unclear] job [unclear].  I’d like to serve in the department [unclear] again.

Bury:  I wanted to ask you about that:  what about the superintendents during your time?  I know the law has changed, but what did you think about the superintendent serving on that board, do you think it was appropriate?  Or was it too much extra work?

Harkins:  Well, what about all the other jobs?  I sat on ten boards.  They were all too much work.  That’s the reason I was defeated.  I worked on all of 'em, and I didn’t campaign, I didn’t play politics.  I had these school people, but they’re not very good at campaigning.  A lot of them are afraid to take an active part in politics.  So their help isn’t the kind of help that gets you elected.  School people were all for me over here in this election.  I imagine I got 90 percent of the school [unclear].

Bury:  Yeah, I think you would.

Harkins:  [unclear]

Bury:  Just because the incumbent had just built up enough of a following?

Harkins:  [unclear] two terms in office.  A lot more people knew him than knew me.  He’d been active in community affairs and church things, [unclear].

Bury:  How did you get along with the press while you were in office?

Harkins:  Well, I....

Bury:  They sort of roasted two of the guys that followed you.

Harkins:  They didn’t give me any honeymoon.  I had a good press, really.  I had Orin Beatty [phonetic].  He was Stu Udall’s administrative aide when he was assistant secretary of Interior.  He was a school board member out at Creighton.  He was part of the Republic.  I had this fellow that lives in Prescott that [grew up with him?], retired to Prescott, at the Republic.  Can’t think of his name now.  I had the guy that’s the editor at Tucson Citizen.  I had Ben Avery [phonetic], who had been the high school sweetheart of my first wife.  I had some real good friends.  I had a tremendous press, really, as you can see, if you want to see my scrapbook.

Bury:  Yeah.  I’ve got a lot of articles here on you that all are very complimentary, and in fact tend to [unclear].  Brooks got quite a bit of flak, and of course Skipper Dick and [unclear] Shofstall had their real bad moments.  Well, did you cultivate the press?  Did you know how to handle them?  Or did you have a good man to handle them for you?

Harkins:  I did most of it myself.  They had free access to me and to the office at all times.  I just knew these guys personally, and they knew that they could call me anytime [unclear] story.  I did most of it myself.  I didn’t have any press agents.

Bury:  How did you and your office get along with the local school districts?  Did you go out, did you [unclear]?

Harkins:  [unclear] beautifully.  I was invited to settle problems [unclear].  I attended the trustees’ meetings, the trustees’ association of <Maricopa County>; and state associations.  I think that I had a good relationship with the [unclear].  I did quite a lot of visiting.  In fact, I visited in every community [unclear] on the White House Conference of ’55.  [unclear] ’56, of course, I was....

Bury:  Major districts, all of them.

Harkins:  [unclear]  Every county seat.  I still have pictures of them in my scrapbook.  I don’t remember any real serious fight I got into with any school district, except I did have to go to <Holbrook> [unclear] attorney general investigation [unclear].  I went up there with-Bob Marshall was the attorney general, but the assistant was....  Can’t think of the fellow’s name right now, but anyway, we drove to Holbrook [unclear] investigation of the Holbrook School District [unclear].  No real educational battle.  I worked very well, I think, with the AEA.

Bury:  How about the universities and the colleges, the deans?  Were you much involved with their programs at the time?

Harkins:  If you look at these things, this one in particular, Dr. Dwayne Manning-he’s over at ASU now, he’s still there-you’ll find in the White House Conference book-it’s not in here-but you’ll find the doctor who was the dean of the College of Education, Dr. McGrath [phonetic], at ASU.  He introduced me at the main White House Conference summary at Phoenix College in late 1955 or early 1956, as "the most dynamic man in Arizona education."  Dean McGrath-he was the dean of the College of Education at ASU.  Dr. Larsen [phonetic] was special committee for philosophies and procedures-Dr. Emil Larsen.  Mr. Football, University of Arizona.  He’s the old dean of the College of Education.  Then the fellow that took his place was [unclear] Yertz [phonetic], who was a high school visitor.

Bury:  Right.  I remember seeing his name on a lot of reports, yeah.

Harkins:  I had beautiful relationships with those people, with all of the colleges.  Of course NAU was my favorite.  We had boards of education meetings at NAU.  One of the pictures in one of my books is of NAU, in one of my reports.  Nineteen fifty-six [1956].

Bury:  Oh yeah, I remember.

Harkins:  That’s NAU.  Wes Townsend, Austin, Harvill, Harkins, McFarland, Eastland [phonetic], Gammage, [unclear].  Gordon Aldrich, that’s the guy right there, assistant attorney general for education.  He’s the guy I went to <Holbrook> with.

Bury:  Oh yeah, I remember this picture.  I was just looking at that.

Harkins:  Here’s the same one in this one.  This must be a supplement to it.  No, this is ’54-’55.  Isn’t that interesting, that both pictures are the same?

Bury:  Well, you had the same board, used the same picture.

Harkins:  I mean, both were made in <Flagstaff>, I believe.

Bury:  Yeah, it’s the same identical picture.  You probably liked it and just left it in there.  You mentioned you were involved in this textbook adoption during your tenure.  And of course that’s one of the crisis issues right now with the state board.  I don’t know if you follow it or not recently, I’m just wondering how you feel about it.  We have a state board that at least part of the board wants to adopt a very restrictive reading list.  What are your feelings in regards to this, what the board’s trying to do today in the state?  One fellow said that if the state board can do this, they can do anything they want later.  That means that they can force school districts to accept whatever they want.

Harkins:  Well, I’ve never been very much in favor of restrictions of any kind, or doing things one way.  For example, there are a lot of people in the different schools of thought about the teaching of reading, and say that the phonics method, or some [other] method is "the only way to teach reading."

Bury:  Right.  This is one of the issues [unclear].

Harkins:  And that’s ridiculous, and it’s, I think, false in that respect, as well as in any other respect.  I learned very early in my teaching days that there’s no one method to teach all children anything.  You teach a child in accordance with his own particular ability and his own particular interests.  The larger the group of kids you have, the more difficult the job becomes.  That’s the reason when we have forty kids in a room, like we had to do during the Depression, and even later when we didn’t have facilities, classrooms, for them, it made teaching such a tough job.  But one of the biggest fights I had anywhere in education at Madison, was the teaching of reading, because we didn’t believe that you taught 'em all one way.  For that reason, you can’t go with one textbook.  And I started early in my career, fighting for a multiple textbook adoption law.  I still believe in that.  And I don’t believe in restrictions on the curriculum, any more than I do on the textbooks, because you’ve got to have a big variety, because you’ve got to motivate a great variety of kids, a great variety of levels of ability in the classroom.  You’ll have everybody in an eighth-grade room; you’ll have everybody in there from third and fourth-grade ability, to high school.  I have a granddaughter that’s down here, [unclear] is a junior, and she’s already had more math than most kids have when they finish high school.  So you have those kinds of children in some fashion [or other], to those that can’t read.  So these restrictions that the state board is trying to put on, are ridiculous.  I don’t think they’ll ever be made into law.  If they are, they won’t be followed, they can’t be implemented.

Bury:  Let me ask you something now.  The conservative element-other interviewees like to use certain names-a very popular name is Latina Rubicon [phonetic]-helped defeat Skipper Dick, and they helped put Sarah Folsom in office.  After Sarah Folsom got in office, she changed her mind about federal funding, and they got down on her, they turned against her.  Then they got-supposedly-this is what I’m saying the other interviewees have said [unclear]-they got Willard [phonetic] Shofstall into office.  And then again, he did not prove to be conservative enough for them.  As he said, he’s got more enemies on the right than he does on the left.  Now, was any of this brewing back then, or did you get off easy before they showed their heads?  Or were they starting to pick on you?  And of course we’re talking about not only these individuals, but we’re talking about a couple of newspapers that also wrote the same way, who have given the last three superintendents a pretty rough time.  Now, had this not happened or developed....  Gosh, we had the end of McCarthyism when you came into office, but were things pretty quiet?

Harkins:  Well, <Arizona> elected a Republican governor before my time.  I made speeches that had something to do with his defeat when I was elected:  one that had to do with federal aid, one that had to do with support of schools [unclear].

Bury:  What was your position on federal aid in this speech?

Harkins:  Well, I was in favor of it.  In fact, I debated it on a national hook-up.  During my term of office [unclear].  Gene Pulliam supported me.  Fritz Marquar [phonetic], the chief editorial writer, was one of my constituents.  His kid, Phillip, went to school with me out in Madison.  You know Phillip Marquar, the judge?

Bury:  Yeah, I know him.

Harkins:  Fritz is the chief editorial writer for the Republic, and I had been to see him during the campaign, [unclear] friend of mine, John Armor, who was on my school board [unclear] Madison [unclear] took me to see Gene Pulliam, and asked him to [unclear].  Gene [unclear] "get all your friends to write me a letter about you, I’ll publish them."  Well, [unclear] was a close friend of mine.  He was superintendent over in Clifton.  I asked him to do this [unclear].  Leif Nelson told me later, "Cliff, the minute I saw that article, I knew I was beat."

Bury:  Yup, there it is.  (pulls clipping from file)  That’s a good article.

Harkins:  I don’t have a copy of this.  [unclear] September 1954.

Bury:  I’ll Xerox it and put it in the mail to you.

Harkins:  Will you?

Bury:  Sure thing.

Harkins:  This is what I’m talking to you about, that’s what happened.  With that support, and with Marquar’s and [unclear] support in the Madison District, he supported me all the way through Madison in all my bond issues.  They couldn’t help but go along.  

But I did notice toward the end of the term they began to cool.  I know in 1956 the conservatism was rising, because Goldwater was in his glory.

Bury:  Right.

Harkins:  He had defeated McFarland.

Bury:  Do you think that if you would have been in office a little longer you might have run into the same type of....

Harkins:  I’m sure I would have.  Incidentally, I had [unclear] conference.  He was the featured speaker.  I made friends with him early.  His wife has done a lot of good and focused attention on reading [unclear].  I worked with him at an Arizona Academy, Castle Hot Springs [unclear].  So I had....

Bury:  You’re mentioning the same people and the same institutions as Skipper Dick has.  You talked about Tom Hall, you’re talking about Rubicons.  Skipper Dick didn’t get along with any of them.  He blasted them in the newspaper, he called them radicals and every other name, but yet you got along.  Now, are you two different philosophies, do you think?

Harkins:  No, but without putting it in the book, Skipper’s sort of a diamond in the rough.  He’s a great guy, a real guy, but he’s quick to say what he thinks.  He used some pretty poor judgement in his later years, [unclear] good citizens.  They were sincere, I think, even though they disagreed in their philosophy.  He called her some kind of a busybody.

Bury:  He called her an old lady in the paper.

Harkins:  Yeah.  [unclear] in that.

Bury:  [unclear]

Harkins:  Anyway, although I have been controversial, I have been a little bit more careful about what I say than Skipper was-at least I was in those days.  I think that’s probably the reason why I didn’t have as much trouble.  I’ll tell you another thing:  some of my friends in Northeast <Phoenix> didn’t know that I was a Democrat, even though I was elected Democrat.  And I’ve had people like Barry Goldwater-the guy that was assistant secretary of Interior [unclear] Arizona Public Service.  Roger Ernst was our state land commissioner.  Roger Ernst offered me a job as commissioner of education [unclear], West Indies.  [unclear] island down there?  He offered me that job as commissioner of education down there the day I signed up to [unclear] as education advisor.  Sunday morning, at the same time-this is after my [unclear]-Jim Patrick got me in [unclear] with the president of University of Chicago, Harvard, Stanford, Yale, and Michigan.

Bury:  This is Jim Patrick, president of [the bank?]

Harkins:  Yeah.  [unclear]  He was one of my leading laymen in this White House Conference [unclear].  He got me [unclear] with that consortium that set up the Kitt Peak thing.  I was offered the job as general manager-I still have the letter-of that construction of Kitt Peak Observatory.

Bury:  Down in <Tucson>.

Harkins:  I was in Washington when I got the letter from Roger Ernst, and I had just agreed the day before to go to <Ecuador> [unclear] college presidents, university presidents [unclear] and Jim Patrick arranged to take that job [unclear].

Bury:  Yeah, my dad [unclear].  Okay, well, I think we’ve covered most of the questions-there’s a few [left]-and then I’d like to fill-in what you did since you left the office.  How do you feel about the other areas of social education that the superintendents are arguing about now?-particularly sex education-but generally social education, drug abuse education, what have you.  How do you think the role of the superintendent should be in that?  Because obviously [unclear].

Harkins:  [unclear] should be a role of leadership just like it is [unclear].  I think of all the possibilities, maybe sex education is the biggest mistake that we could possibly make.  I think the more of the good things about sexual life or sexuality we could teach our kids through better [unclear].  I don’t believe in hiding it behind the bedroom door by any means.  I had sex education in Madison schools in the seventh and eighth grades.  We had seventh and eighth-grade dances.  Do you remember?  Menstruation film, and that’s twenty years ago, twenty-five years ago.

Bury:  [unclear] program started, I think, in the sixth grade there.

Harkins:  Did it damage your sensibilities or your sense of values, or did it help you?

Bury:  I’ll have to ask my wife.  (laughs)  Oh, you know, the sooner children can be educated-I think I feel this way with my own kids-the better.  I don’t have any qualifications, I just see that....  I think what I’m getting at is the question of whether a superintendent should-how involved they should become, particularly if they have a particular moral or religious view, say, as the parents [unclear], is particularly a very strong social point of view [unclear].  Does he have a responsibility to interject this?  Or is this something that’s local control [unclear]?

Harkins:  [unclear] bachelor, you know, and he never had any children.

Bury:  He’s got three.

Harkins:  Shofstall?

Bury:  Three girls.

Harkins:  Of his own, or hers?

Bury:  I’m not sure of that.

Harkins:  I don’t think he has any children.

Bury:  I do know he got married late [unclear].

Harkins:  What do his kids do?

Bury:  I don’t know.  He has three daughters.

Harkins:  Do you know them?

Bury:  No.  But even in his biography in Who’s Who he’s listed with three children, three daughters.

Harkins:  I didn’t know.  I was told he didn’t have any children.  [unclear]

Bury:  He’s pretty strict.

Harkins:  Oh yeah, he has a lot of [unclear].  I’ve read everything he said since he was elected.  I went in person the day after he was appointed, or the next week, told him I was going to be looking over his shoulder.  I probably should have run against him.  [unclear]  A lot of people [unclear].

Bury:  Shofstall [unclear] four years [unclear].  Well, what did you do when you left the office?

Harkins:  [unclear]  They’re still using my guidelines [unclear].

Bury:  How long did you stay with them?

Harkins:  One year.

Bury:  And then did you go back?

Harkins:  Then I went to....  Every meeting I went to, everywhere I went, people were patting on my shoulder, couldn’t believe what I [unclear].  I got sick and tired of it.  I was still dickering to get into an administrative position.  January of ’57 I was invited to <Boise Idaho>.  Out of forty applicants, a third [unclear] superintendent in <Albuquerque> and <Santa Fe>, and I were the two finalists.  We were invited up there [unclear] expense.  We each had our time with the board, half a day each.  They asked me how much money I wanted.  I had friends in <Phoenix> on the board, I had it in the bag.  I said, "I want to start at a minimum of $12,000 with a three or four-year contract."  They asked Pop the same question.  He and I were staying together at the hotel.  They asked him the same question, he said, "Whatever you think is right."  [unclear]  They invited him back after dinner and he got the job. I very nearly became commissioner of education in the state of <Colorado>.  I had met the guy who was chairman of the board, and was a banker, an old Scotch banker, in <Colorado Springs>, and they invited me up there.  I missed all that, didn’t want [unclear] Democrat now, they got to Gary Hart, senator up there this year.  [unclear] The commissioner of education died, down in <Michigan>, and that position was open, and I applied for the position of commissioner of education [unclear] secretary [unclear].  I had a telegram, recommendation signed by Barry Goldwater, Carl Hayden, [unclear], Stu Udall, and John Rhodes.

Bury:  Can’t beat that.

Harkins:  And I presented it to the guy, had a beautiful interview, and went to see Howard Pyle [phonetic].  He was over at the White House, [unclear].  He said, "Cliff, you belong to the wrong party."  I didn’t get the job.  [unclear]. So I went to Washington.  I was invited by HEW to apply for a job as the education director of [unclear], and I went to Washington to [unclear].  I decided I didn’t want the damned job.  [unclear].  I ran into Dean Wyman [phonetic], who’d been in the State Department since 1946, and he said, "Cliff, we need [unclear].  Why don’t you apply?"  I said, "Okay, I’ll go [unclear]" application.  First thing you know, they offered me three different jobs [unclear].

Bury:  [unclear]

Harkins:  [unclear] Santo Domingo?  Not Santo Domingo.

Bury:  I know what you mean.

Harkins:  Well anyway, I didn’t want to go down there.  Then they offered me a job [unclear].  This kid that run for the Senate against [Taft?], out of Carl Hayden’s office.  He was the contact [unclear] offered me a job.  [unclear]  So then they sent me [unclear] and said, "This is the last offer."  So I was [unclear] navy [unclear] forty-eight hours to [unclear].  So I ended up [unclear].

Bury:  How long were you there?

Harkins:  Over two years.

Bury:  And you were the educational advisor to the government there for our State Department.

Harkins:  [unclear] education service.  Four basic services [unclear] education, public health, agriculture, [unclear].

Bury:  Cultural?

Harkins:  Well, it was either public administration or civil aeronautics or security.  [unclear]  In <Ecuador> it was ... industry!  Industry.

Bury:  Now, when you came back from <Ecuador>, what did you do?

Harkins:  Well, I was here on sixty-day home leave.  I finished my dissertation [unclear].  I had done the work down there, and cert before I left, wrote it down there.  The girl in <Ecuador> [unclear] didn’t use any punctuation or capital letters.  I had to do it over again, of course.  [unclear]  I sent it up, and it was turned down.  [unclear]  So I came home and I went to [unclear] rewrite the last chapter.  [unclear] last chapter [unclear] English teacher to let me [unclear] rewrite it.  Cost me $495 to [unclear]. Before I left <Ecuador>, I had written a letter just out of curiosity, to ask about a transfer to <Africa>.  They had already reassigned me as the chief of education in <Ecuador>.  Of course everybody in the State Department had decided to save <Africa>.  We only had about twenty people in the State Department that knew anything about <Africa>-real <Africa>.  So I came home and finished my dissertation in <San Diego>, did two weeks in the naval reserve.  Came home, I got a call from [unclear] and they said, "Are you enjoying your home leave?"  I said, "Yes."  And she said, [unclear].  I said, "Yes, [unclear]."  She said, "No you’re not, you’re going to <Africa>."  I said, "Oh, tell me about it."  She said, [unclear].  This is 1960.

Bury:  How long were you there?

Harkins:  I wrote a letter, she wrote me a letter, and I was called to Washington.  That was in June of ’60.  [unclear] Washington [unclear].  She has two girls and I have four kids.  They kept me in Washington for a week, then sent me to Boston University, through the <Africa> [unclear] Training Program, two months.  Then they sent me to [unclear] for two months.  Then to [unclear], then to <Paris>.  No, then to <Brussels>, then to <Paris>, to study the social and economic....  Those three [unclear] powers [unclear] in <Africa> for the past 400 years.  [unclear]  I’ll show you my [unclear].  I’ve got a four-drawer legal file out in the garage, full of paper.  Arizona State University’s asked me for them, and I think I’ll [unclear].

Bury:  [unclear] That’s great.  That’ll be good.

Harkins:  Anyway, I was in training from the first of July until the day before Kennedy was elected [unclear] Washington.  [unclear] met me there.  She’d been in an apartment in <Virginia>.  I went into the office and I had to prepare for <Kenya>.  [unclear] because I didn’t speak French.  I spoke Spanish pretty good.  And the chief said, "Cliff, you’re going to <Dakar>."  [unclear] quarantined me.  I flew around over <Africa>, trying to establish some interest in American educational programs.  [unclear] 

Bury:  Why did the State Department ever send you there?  Didn’t they [unclear]?

Harkins:  That’s the biggest question in my life, really.  The ambassador said [unclear].  Incidentally, my director in <Ecuador> was Jack [unclear], who later became director of the Peace Corps, and assistant secretary of state for South America.  He was our director, he and the ambassador [unclear] Dean Rusk, asking him to suspend the program and transfer me where I could work, because I couldn’t even get a hotel reservation [unclear] Chinese Communists and <Russia>.  I got [unclear].  Well, they were the same as our secretary of Health, Education, and [Welfare?].  I got [unclear] with the guy in [agriculture?], Papa John [phonetic].  Papa John is a big beautiful city, flourishing, 1,500 miles south of <Dakar>.  I flew down there and [unclear] <Liberia> [unclear] hoping the weather would clear a little bit.  Got down there, went through all the rigmarole and protocol of getting to the ambassador and to the education secretary.  [unclear] eleven o’clock in the morning, and he had left at ten o’clock with his wife, to <Paris> for a vacation.  [unclear]

Bury:  That’s so frustrating!

Harkins:  Well, it completely knocked me out.  I went back [unclear], and they immediately assigned me to [unclear] <Afghanistan>, then to East <Pakistan>, and finally to [unclear] to Taiwan.  But I went to take my physical [unclear] and I couldn’t pass the physical.  [unclear] six months [unclear].  Nothing to do.  Didn’t even go to the campus of the best university in <Africa>, [unclear].  Couldn’t go on the campus.  And then [unclear].

Bury:  So you left the service then?

Harkins:  I came home.  I stayed in Washington over a year before I could get out.

Bury:  What were you doing?

Harkins:  I was briefing people going and coming from <Africa> on commissions in education-and <South America> too, [unclear], ’62, [unclear] two jobs.  And you and Leif Nelson.  Leif Nelson [unclear] retired from the superintendency in Safford.  Leif took the job in manpower, I took the job in civil defense.  [unclear]  I went to [unclear] for a year and a half [unclear] first woman [unclear] academy and Tom Hall, we got the department of corrections to acknowledge my job and the state board [unclear].  The last year I was with 'em, I became a special assistant to [unclear] for community relations, working with groups [unclear] attendance, [unclear].  Then retired September 1, ’73, and ran a conference for the college [unclear] regional conference, nineteen states [unclear].  The American Association of Community and Junior Colleges [unclear].  Went down to <Texas> to see my mother.  She was ninety-five the twenty-first of September.  While I was there, the governors [unclear].  I was a consultant for six weeks [unclear].  Elected me chairman of the board the eighth of January, and I served as chairman of the board for six months, and they asked me to be the director of [unclear], run the school until I could find somebody to [unclear].  That’s what I’m doing now.

Bury:  Where is this [unclear]?

Harkins:  [unclear] 15 West, down the road.

Bury:  [unclear]

Harkins:  Nineteen miles.

Bury:  What are you doing out there?

Harkins:  I’m the director.

Bury:  You’re running the school itself?  What programs are you offering?

Harkins:  School for retarded children.

Bury:  Now is this mentally retarded?

Harkins:  Mentally retarded.

Bury:  What age group?

Harkins:  Zero to thirty-two.

Bury:  Is it purely MR’s, or do you have any LD’s or anything else?

Harkins:  [unclear]

Bury:  Severe MR’s?

Harkins:  That’s the first prerequisite, mental retardation.  They have 215 kids in residence, and 180 on campus, 32 in three halfway houses, moving from the school to the community; and a vocational school [unclear] 75 kids in it.  [unclear]  I have 207 employees [unclear].

Bury:  Where do you get most of your funding?

Harkins:  A $550,000 contract with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, about $160,000 contract [unclear], $190,000 contract with [unclear].  And then $100,000 a year from United Way.  We do a lot of mooching from all the service clubs.  We have an auxiliary that runs a thrift store, makes about a thousand dollars a month.  They gave us $16,000 last year.  It’s a combination of administration, fundraising, mental retardation, education, [unclear].[End of Recording]
