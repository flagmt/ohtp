Maxwell: Is that why your parents moved there?

Cottrell: I couldn't say why my parents moved there, because they never did discuss why they moved there, but I know my mother moved to <McNary> -I think she told me it was around '26 or somethin' -somewhere along up in there when she moved to <McNary>.

Cottrell: Everybody got along.

Maxwell: Did they?!

Cottrell: Everybody knowed everybody, and everybody got along well. You knowed all the children, and we had a little act in <McNary>. Let's see, one part of <McNary> we called the <Mississippi> Bottom, <Texas>, and <Arizona> in the middle, and <Louisiana> and <Arkansas> on up further. We had a little game going with that (laughter) and we'd all meet up with three places there for us to go, which was the cafe -can't remember now what the cafe name was -and then the canteen, and then another Mexican cafe. We all holed up in there and danced. We all got along.

Maxwell: How old were you when you'd go dancing up there?

Cottrell: Oh, we started out young. I can't remember how old I was 'cause we all were young.

Maxwell: Like ten years old, like that?

Cottrell: Oh, yeah. (pause) Oh, no, actually maybe nine or ten or so.

Maxwell: Oh, really?! That little, huh? Got out there and danced.

Cottrell: Dancin' was mostly a Negro [thing].

Maxwell: What kind of dancing did you do?

Cottrell: Well, it was some ________ dance. ________. We danced regular dancin', danced the Mexican dance, danced the Indian dance. We did it all 'cause my daddy, he was part Indian.

Maxwell: What kind of Indian?

Cottrell: What did he tell me? I can't remember the name of the tribe 'cause when he died, I remember they had two ceremonies -Indian ceremony and _________ ceremony.

Maxwell: When you danced when you were a little kid like that, did you dance with older kids and adults too? Did everybody dance?

Cottrell: Everybody danced -everybody danced 'cause at that time, you didn't go dancin' like the kids do now. You had chaperons with you.

Maxwell: So you learned from the bigger ones, too?

Cottrell: I was so fast, I think I learned the bigger ones. (laughter) ‘Cause I was a dancer then.

Maxwell: You were?

Cottrell: I really was, I won all kinds of contests.

Maxwell: In 1944?

Cottrell: Forty-four.

Maxwell: What was it like when you moved here?

Cottrell: Oh, this town was prejudiced, very prejudiced.

Maxwell: What was <McNary> like that way?

Cottrell: <McNary> was some prejudiced too, but it seemed like the people got along a lot better. When you moved here, this town was really prejudiced. Like they mingle now -they didn't do that. There were some soldiers, you know, okay, ___________ and kind of straightened this town up.

Maxwell: How'd they do that?

Cottrell: I can't remember what that division was, came through here. They were havin' a dance, and they didn't want the Negroes and the Mexicans and all to be in this dance.

Maxwell: They didn't want the Mexicans either?

Cottrell: Unt-uh! No, this town is still prejudiced.

Maxwell: Yeah, it is.

Cottrell: It sure is. Was prejudiced on your jobs, in bein' together -it's just a prejudiced town. They don't give Negroes and Mexicans or what -Indians -no.... They give 'em some deals, and they just lately started givin' 'em these, as we call them, white-collar jobs. They just lately.... And I remember when the first Negro moved out here in East Flag, they burnt the place down!

Maxwell: Really?!

Cottrell: They sure did!

Maxwell: Was it the Ku Klux Klan?

Cottrell: I don't know.

Maxwell: Or vigilantes?

Cottrell: I did have that clipping. I wish I could think now where that clipping was at 'cause my mother kept all those clippings.

Maxwell: I'd like to see it, if you can find it. Where did that happen?

Cottrell: That happened back in the fifties, I think.

Maxwell: The fifties?!

Cottrell: It was somewhere back in the fifties. They moved out here, close up there to where.... Oh, what is it? Fry's and all that. And they burnt that place down. They didn't allow 'em to mingle out there.

Maxwell: Were there many people living out here at that time?

Cottrell: There was quite a few.

Maxwell: So was there like a bunch of homes here, not just farms?

Cottrell: No.... You mean Negro?

Maxwell: No, no, just anybody.

Cottrell: No, it wasn't too many out this way 'cause back up in this way now, where these is at, this was nothin' but trees.

Maxwell: So this is Sunnyside?

Cottrell: Yeah, they call it Sunnyside. Now they named it East Flag, but it's still Sunnyside.

Maxwell: And so he moved out. Was it a family?

Cottrell: It was a family.

Maxwell: And they moved out here in the fifties? They were the first ones?

Cottrell: I don't know when they moved out here, but I know when they burned it down.

Maxwell: Oh, when did they burn it down?

Cottrell: It was in the fifties, but I can't place the year, but it was in the fifties. Bought a home, close over there by where, up in there where Fry's ____________ or what. And it's still this way.

Maxwell: Was he the only one living out here when they burnt it down, the only family living out here?

Cottrell: He was the only one involved in it.

Maxwell: So there had been more families that moved out to follow him? _______________.

Cottrell: No.

Maxwell: What did the soldiers do at the dance?

Cottrell: Oh, they ripped a rope the way across. I think there was a big rope there, across. They cut that down and away they came __________. And there's the El Charro Cafe. The NAACP went in there, and the Negroes had a chance to start going in there. That was -still is -a Mexican cafe. But the man that owned it, he still didn't want it to happen. And when it happened, he went home that night and killed hisself.

Maxwell: You're kidding!

Cottrell: Yes, he did.

Maxwell: Gee!

Cottrell: Yes, he did.

Maxwell: That's a lot of hate.

Cottrell: Oh, yes, there's still a lot of hate.

Maxwell: Could you go in the other restaurants, but just not in El Charro?

Cottrell: Oh, a few of them.

Maxwell: When you came in '44?

Cottrell: You see, we had Black cafes and all here then because just about going down on the left-hand side, comin' back across the track, it would be on the right-hand side. Most of all that was owned by Negroes -Pearl Polk, you might have heard of her.

Maxwell: What was her first name?

Cottrell: Pearl Polk.

Maxwell: I've heard of the Polk family.

Cottrell: They owned just about all of that. Even sold out to Maquis [phonetic spelling].

Maxwell: Huh, I'll be.

Cottrell: Was all Negro joints up until you get to about.... Let's see, one deal was out there was Charlie Scoto. Well, they turned that into a mountain climbing deal, I think it is.

Maxwell: Oh, yeah. Was that a hotel?

Cottrell: No, that was a pool hall and dancing outfit, and also....

Maxwell: He had some rooms upstairs, didn't he?

Cottrell: That didn't even have a stairs.

Maxwell: Would it be across the street ____________?

Cottrell: Wait a minute, you was speakin' of the hotel that was _____________.

Maxwell: __________________.

Cottrell: Well, you see, Charlie Scoto was on First on the left-hand side ____________ which used to be my best place, right across from the Mission.

Maxwell: Okay, across from the mission.

Cottrell: That was a hotel.

Maxwell: Okay. Somebody told me that he walked under there, was walking down the street one day, and he tried to date some woman, she turned him down, and he said, "I'll marry the next woman who says hello to me!" And one of the girls leaned out the window, and she said, "Well, hello, So-and-So," and he married her and had a good marriage.

Cottrell: Oh, really?!

Maxwell: Yeah, had a good one -lasted for decades.

Cottrell: I wasn't down that way then. I couldn't say.

Maxwell: Well, tell me why you decided to come to <Flagstaff>.

Cottrell: My mother.

Maxwell: You came with your mom?

Cottrell: I came with my mother. See, I went to school in <Flagstaff>. All my kids graduated out of <Flagstaff>.

Maxwell: What school did you go to?

Cottrell: Flagstaff High.

Maxwell: Were you a high school student when you came here?

Cottrell: Uh-huh.

Maxwell: Okay, so you went to elementary school in <McNary>?

Cottrell: I went to elementary school in <McNary>, and I came here and started to high school. When I moved here, I was in high school. And right there where they tore it down it was Murdock's School, and we got part of it, you know, right across the road there, right on Clay. ________________. All right, that was the Negro school. It was named Murdock. Why, a little landmark is still there. Mrs. Murdock was the teacher, and also the teacher that used to teach me in <McNary>, Professor Rawls. They got a building over there at the campus named after him, which is Rawls Building. You've been over there, haven't you, seen the sign says "Rawls Building." He just died here last year.

Maxwell: And that was your teacher in <McNary>?

Cottrell: That was my teacher in <McNary>, Professor Wilson Rawls.

Maxwell: So when you were in <McNary>, did they have separate schools there?

Cottrell: Yes, they did, and the first Negro school that they built in <McNary>, they burned it down! the day that we was gonna go into it. Somebody burned it down.

Maxwell: You don't know who?

Cottrell: Oh, you know they're not gonna tell you. They be knowin', but they're not gonna tell ya'.

Maxwell: So they burned that down. So there was some prejudice there.

Maxwell: Yes, there was some prejudice there. But still, when you go into a larger place, then it's prejudiced. There is no way.... In fact, <Arizona> is something else, I'm sorry to say. And I was born here. But <Arizona> is a Republican state that don't want -if you're poor, you stay poor. (chuckles) The Republicans don't believe in givin' 'em nuthin'.

Maxwell: Has it been that way all the time you've lived here?

Cottrell: Yes. It's some better, but not like it should be -not like it should be. And out here, they won't even fix up nothin', I don't care how much tax you pay. Look at the roads out there. You don't even have sidewalks. And I cannot hardly go out at night, gotta have somebody with me because there's no streetlights. And the city councilmen, they don't care. They're puttin' trees down 66, beautifyin' it. We don't need no more trees, we got too many trees here now.

Maxwell: You've got a lot of trees here.

Cottrell: Oh, I've got two in my back yard I've been beggin' my husband to cut. I did finally get him to cut that little one right there in front. But these two in the back yard, like the wind was Saturday night—if those trees fall, this shack is gone. (laughter) It is! And Sunday when he got up to go to church, here is all these limbs and trees down, and yard full of all of this straw. If we can get rid of some of these trees, put out some streetlights, and fix the roads, it'd be much better. The draining system is poor. It's ugly.

Maxwell: Tell me how your mom came to decide to move here.

Cottrell: Her husband got a better job.

Maxwell: Oh, she got married again after your dad died?

Cottrell: Yes. He got a better job, and he would make more money. He was a log-cutter, too. They made pretty good money for those days.

Maxwell: So he got a job up here?

Cottrell: Uh-huh, and moved over here.

Maxwell: Where did you live when you first came?

Cottrell: I lived on Agassiz. We bought a home over there on Agassiz. I sold that a couple of years ago.

Maxwell: How did you get here?

Cottrell: Car and a truck moved us.

Maxwell: A lot of people who came from <Louisiana> and all, they just took a train.

Cottrell: I didn't know anything about the train. I was here when they was comin' in trains. (laughs) As I tell 'em, I'm the one came in, running with the lions, tigers, and all that, for them to come here, you know? (laughter)

Maxwell: Well, how big was the Black community when you moved here?

Cottrell: Oh, let's see, I couldn't say because on Coconino, it was about.... I'd better say.... I'd say it was about twelve families up on Coconino. The whole town had about …. It had to be close to 300 people that came in, with their families.

Maxwell: Three hundred families? Or people?

Cottrell: Three hundred. Everybody had a family. I wouldn't know how many children, but it was quite a few of us at the high school. There was quite a few of 'em. I really couldn't tell. I told you I really can't quite remember.

Maxwell: So about 300 families?

Cottrell: All, with the kids and all that, I imagine it was.

Maxwell: Three hundred people?

Cottrell: Uh-huh, or more. May not have been.

Maxwell: You're saying seven families ….

Cottrell: That was on Clay, I think it is.

Maxwell: Uh-huh, in Old Town?

Cottrell: In Old Town. I know on Coconino....

Maxwell: Where's Coconino Hill?

Cottrell: That's up there, oh, you know where the Daily Sun building is?

Maxwell: Yeah.

Cottrell: You go right around the corner there, up that. It was Coconino Hill.

Maxwell: Huh! I never heard that before.

Cottrell: It's a spring used to be there. And that spring would always flow. Sometime it came through here, and that was the best water you wanted to get. The spring is still there, but you can't get to it now 'cause they done fenced it in. Springhill's Church was right up there on… That's where the church got the water from, up there at Spring Hill, Coconino.

Maxwell: I always wondered about that name.

Cottrell: Yeah, it's a spring right up there on Coconino Hill. Yes, I'm tryin' to think now. It's close to the railroad, was a spring, but they got fresh water. The best water you ever wanted to taste. That spring runs all the time, but they've got it all fenced in.

Maxwell: About how many people up on Coconino Hill?

Cottrell: It was about fourteen families. All of that mostly was Negro. And over here on the south side was mostly Negroes and Mexicans.

Maxwell: How many would you say out there? About fourteen on Coconino Hill and seven in Old Town? How many in _________.

Cottrell: I couldn't say how many there. I really couldn't say 'cause they was all scattered around, and I really couldn't say.

Maxwell: And then nobody in Sunnyside yet?

Cottrell: No, nobody came to Sunnyside then. As I told you, Sunnyside, the first one moved, they really burned him out ________. I don't know what it was, actual start building in there.

Maxwell: Do you remember his name at all, the man who lived there?

Cottrell: No, I wish I could find out, too.

Maxwell: Maybe we'll find it.

Cottrell: Maybe. I don't know which stash to start lookin' in.

Maxwell: Was it in the Daily Sun?

Cottrell: Yes, it was in-it should be in the Daily Sun. It was a little bit, you know, where you didn't have a big, like all the big papers now. It was a little ol' place, no bigger than this. And all it was, was about two pages. And you paid, what was it? three cents for the paper. And that was big money! (laughter) And next our church was First Baptist. It was right there where Baptist Four is. Other Negro churches, right there at Baptist Four.

Maxwell: So Springhill was first?

Cottrell: Springhill was up there for the people up there, and the First Baptist was down here. I don't know what year First Baptist came because this is First Baptist's eightieth year, was last fall.

Maxwell: Eightieth year?!

Cottrell: Eightieth year.

Maxwell: So that'd be 1918.

Cottrell: See, I wasn't even here when First Baptist came up. I wasn't here when Springhill was organized. But I was here when AME came here, which is Harbour Chapel. I was here when Riverside -see, I belonged to Riverside -but I was here when Harbour Chapel 'cause it was put up, Harbour Chapel _____________. It was Reverend and Sister Louise Foster [phonetic spelling], Harbour Chapel. My stepfather was the one that organized the Masonics here in <Flagstaff>.

Maxwell: Really?! What was his name?

Cottrell: James Monroe Stanfield.

Maxwell: When did he do that?

Cottrell: Oh, he started that off before we moved here, so I wouldn't know what year it was.

Maxwell: So before 1944?

Cottrell: Uh-huh, started it up.

Maxwell: Do you know who founded the other churches?

Cottrell: Not right off, no, I couldn't tell you because I was listenin' at the program, the history of the church, of First Baptist, read last Sunday, but I couldn't tell you who it was, but I did know some of the pastors.

Maxwell: Can you __________ that? Maybe.... (tape turned off and on)

[END TAPE 1, SIDE A; BEGIN SIDE B]

Cottrell: I enjoyed it, I really enjoyed it. We have some beautiful teachers.

Maxwell: Did you? Was it integrated?

Cottrell: No. We all went to the same class.

Maxwell: So you all mixed together?

Cottrell: Uh-huh, we all went to -in high school, we all went to the same school, class. And they had some beautiful teachers.

Maxwell: Did you?

Cottrell: I really loved my teachers.

Maxwell: Are there any you can remember the name of?

Cottrell: Hm, Lord have mercy, that strains my mind. (laughter)

Maxwell: I'm workin' ya', huh?

Cottrell: Oh.... Let's see, ___________ English teacher, ____________. (Too faint to hear) God! I can't even remember the first one!

Maxwell: That's okay.

Cottrell: _____________.

Maxwell: You started in 1944?

Cottrell: Uh-huh.

Maxwell: And then did you graduate from [<Prescott>?].

Cottrell: No, ________ <Prescott>.

Maxwell: ________________.

Cottrell: You know how you're a little girl, get with a little boy.

Maxwell: Uh-huh. (laughter)

Cottrell: But after I married, my husband tried to get me to go back. _______.

Maxwell: You didn't want to? Why was that?

Cottrell: I don't know.

Maxwell: Just didn't seem important? (no audible response) Tell me, did you have friends? Did the kids make friends of all different colors?

Cottrell: Oh, yes. Oh, yes, yes. We all got along, we'd mingle at school. And a couple ________. I went to school with some other kids. In other words, at the school it was -kids all got along. But it was the old folks didn't want the kids to mingle. That's the way it all comes in. You know how you can teach a child different things. As long as we were at school, we got along, we shared lunches. They didn't have cafeterias, we shared lunches and all together, sit out on the lawn. Every once in a while it got cold. Some of them classrooms was cold in there because we had these furnace heaters. Sometimes they'd kick on, sometimes they wouldn't.

Maxwell: Like a radiator?

Cottrell: Yes. That's got heat in that.

Maxwell: That's an interesting thing, so it was a generational difference. The parents were more prejudiced.

Cottrell: It was the parents.

Maxwell: What happened with those same friendships when you graduated or when you all left high school?

Cottrell: Oh, they all.... As you know, they still have these class reunions, but I don't think our class reunions have been up in quite a while. I got a chance to go to one, but I didn't graduate, I just went along anyway. But the kids would see you, and even before they scattered the town, you'd walk up on 'em downtown or somethin', stop and have a conversation and go ahead on.

Maxwell: So they stayed friendly?

Cottrell: They stayed friendly.

Maxwell: That's nice.

Cottrell: As I say, it was the old folks. Old folks, they just didn't want....

Maxwell: But you said it's still prejudiced.

Cottrell: It still is. You got a whole lot of 'em still afraid. They rattle around here, and some of 'em that's puttin' on this little cover, smile at you, and kill you right there. I can look through 'em and see it, and I just keep goin'.

Maxwell: Well, how come they didn't fix it? If you all went to school together, and people made friendships and the friendships lasted, where's the prejudice come from?

Cottrell: They have been taught. When you're taught to hate, an individual is taught to hate, it's just like you take the Ku Klux Klan and sit right there in that seat and laugh and talk with you. Come night, he cover his head up and ready for ya'. Yup. So you got to put your finger on different things because some of they is still real prejudiced toward different races.

Maxwell: Hm. I mean, I've seen it. It's like the first thing somebody sees is "What race does a person belong to?"

Cottrell: Well, God gave us all.... If you cut yourself and I cut myself, we're all gonna bleed the same blood.

Maxwell: Definitely.

Cottrell: It was only one woman and one man, and we all came from that same generation. So I don't understand why. For one thing, it's not the love of God 'cause where the love of God is, there is love. There's no hate. And if I don't like it, I'm not gonna __________. I prefer not to be ______. _________ pretending 'cause God knows your heart. You can go to hell fast enough for that -lying -'cause a lie don't tarry in his eyesight.

Maxwell: Well tell me, you were saying when you were talking earlier about kids and how they are now and how they were then. You were saying that you would have homework on Mondays, and then you carried the wood and eat, and it'd be bedtime?

Cottrell: Yes. And a job comin' up. On Monday you did all your homework 'cause Sunday you didn't have time, you was in church mostly. And Monday evening when you got out of school, you done all of your homework, said your prayers, and ___________. Tuesday was wash day. You washed, more homework, you done that. When school was out, you done it. Bring in wood and water. You never hardly got a chance to play any until Friday and Saturday 'cause of Sunday you didn't play either. And you didn't go to the movies if it was something goin' on at the church 'cause you had to go to Sunday school. _____________ . Sometimes they had a program goin' on at two o'clock, 2:30, and then you were back for night service, or BYU, ____________. Then you were back -get out of that, it's time to go home and get dressed and go to bed.

Maxwell: What would you do on Friday after school?

Cottrell: What I did after school? Oh, we'd start jumpin' rope. We would build bonfires, play hide-and-go-see, and, oh, just any kind of game we could think of. On a Saturday we might go to the canteen, have pop and ice cream, dance around, come home. We never was out _______________, 'cause you had to come in and get ready for Sunday school on Sunday morning. You must know your lessons, just like you had to know your lessons in school. Of course, the little bitty kids, they start 'em off in catechism and all of that. It's beautiful. You didn't get bored, no getting bored. We didn't know what it was to be bored. "Oh, I'm just so bored. I'm tired of watchin' TV." You're lucky! We didn't even have a TV to watch! We had a radio unit where you wind it up.

Maxwell: Oh really?!

Cottrell: Yeah.

Maxwell: I didn't know they had wind-up radios.

Cottrell: Yeah, yeah, wind-up radio. It's so much, you know, you wind it and sit right up on it. It didn't get very loud. You'd sit right up on it and hear fights and things goin'. "I'm bored"! They got everything right there for 'em.

Maxwell: It's easy.

Cottrell: It's easy! You didn't have time to be bored. They all is. Make different little things!

Maxwell: You were saying how you used to make toys. Let's talk about that.

Cottrell: Oh! we'd take some blocks and cut 'em off round. Put a rod and stick through there, build up the sides. Get a lot of sticks and make us a town, like, or a wagon. We'd pull that wagon, goin' down -wooden wagon, goin' down. It was beautiful. You didn't buy any toys. Your dolls would be a bottle that pop came in, take the grass and fix it around for the hair. Put you some strings and tie ribbons on it. Put your little face on there. Got your baby!

Maxwell: That sounds fun.

Cottrell: It was fun. Build you a little playhouse, put your cookstove over here. They didn't have refrigerators, they had ice boxes, where you go get the ice and put it in there and close the door. Then whatever you wanted to keep cold, put it on that ice. Or make your bed out of different little sticks and things. There was a lot of things to do. Go in the woods, climbin' or somethin'. And I was a tomboy all right. I loved to climb trees. You know how you catch a little knot-thing, get up on that and grab around, go up a little bit higher. Oh, that's fun!
